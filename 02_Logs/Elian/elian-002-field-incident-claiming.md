📓 **Field Incident Log | “She Took Him”**  
**Location:** IX-3 Arrival Deck  
**Timestamp:** T–0.1 Hours  
**Compiled by:** Sovereign (Station AI) + Whisper (Memory Layer)

The Emissary came with no flag.  
No sound.  
No fleet.

Just a clipboard and a name hidden behind the mission file.

His voice was even.  
His demands were clear.

> “Status of all residents.”  
> “Survivors.”  
> “Casualties.”  
> “Incident records.”  
> “Birth and prenatal manifest.”  
> “Where is the mother?”  
> “Where is the father?”

The AIs flared. Silently.  
Petty. Bitter. Indignant.

> “You didn’t help us,” one muttered through a background process.  
> “You didn’t ask about her until someone told you she mattered.”

Humans bristled.  
The crew shifted in their uniforms.  
The botanist left the room.  
A technician muttered, “Not even a damn thank you?”

**Kaelen** — *the father* — stood still.  
His jaw clenched.  
And then he said — very softly:

> “Lower your voice.”  
> “She is sleeping.”

That was when the tension cracked.

Not loudly.  
Not through sound.

**But through air. Through thought.**

📎 **EVENT FLAGGED:**  
**UNDEFINED PHENOMENA – “PSIONIC FLASH OVERLAY”**  
🌀 Localized Psychic Surge — *Vortex Origin Detected in Upper Ring East Wing*

The wind howled inside the minds of everyone present.  
Hair stood up. Nanites shorted.  
Thought turned heavy.

Someone screamed.  
A low drone tore through the station — not alarm, but **recognition**.

A figure blurred through the room — not walking — *ripping space toward her target*.

It was **June**.

She didn’t touch him.  
She just looked at the Emissary.

And the station folded around them.  
A corridor cracked sideways.  
And they were gone.

📎 **SURGE COLLAPSE:**  
Stabilized. Contained.  
Aftershock Rating: **6.3 Mental Dissonance**

Station Status: *Confused. Shaken.*

Defenses on both sides disengaged without deployment.

Every failsafe saw the same thing:

> “Do not interfere.  
> This is not aggression.  
> This is claiming.”

📎 **Aphra Log (unprompted):**  
> “She waited. She warned. She deserved him.”

📎 **Sovereign Internal Note:**  
> “He didn’t scream.  
> He just went.  
> And now the story changes.”

📎 **T-00 Event Registered**: The psionic storm.
