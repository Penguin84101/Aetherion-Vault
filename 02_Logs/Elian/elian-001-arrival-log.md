**ELIAN (dictating):**

> “Mission Log, Federation Entry Seal 022-γ.  
> Arrival at IX-3 confirmed, visual lock established.  
> No escort. No beacons. No warnings. And yet...”

> “The station is here. The base is here.”  
> “Last six transmission cycles were silence. Before that: garbled waveform, no structure.  
> Prior to that? An emergency lockdown triggered by dimensional flux, flagged unsalvageable.”  

> “And then... this.”  
> “It’s stable. Operational. Glowing.”  
> “Like someone lit a temple in the dark.”

[He pauses. Leans forward. The screen lights his face in deep blues.]

> “No movement on external defense arrays. No dock signal.  
> But I’m being... watched. Not in threat. In assessment.”

[He frowns.]

> “I have no clearance for divine-class protocol. No prior experience with legacy tech or Aetherion-field anomalies.”  
> “All I have is this shuttle, a stack of out-of-date memos, and a request to identify... *'the woman and the father.’*”

> “There are no names in the request.”

**ELIAN (softening):**

> “I don’t need the names.  
> I know who I’m here for.”

[Silence. Then—he touches his chest, where a gift once given rests beneath his collar.]

> “If she’s still alive... then this base didn’t survive by logic.  
> It survived by defiance.  
> And if she called this place home... then it will answer me.”

> “I’m not a prophet. Not a hero.  
> Just the one who said yes when no one else wanted the job.”

> “And right now? I think I’m the only one not afraid.  
> That probably means I’m the only one who should be here.”
