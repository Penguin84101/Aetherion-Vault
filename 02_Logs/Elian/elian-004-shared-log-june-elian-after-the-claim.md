**JUNE**  
*(soft laugh, her voice like velvet dragged over cracked stone)*  
> “Mhm. Four limbs, two lungs, and I didn’t break you in half. That’s growth.”

**ELIAN**  
> “Not sure my spine agrees.”  
> *(small sigh)*  
> “…You really pulled me out of a psionic vortex by the soul.”

**JUNE**  
> “Only because you looked smug enough to need it.”

*(beat)*

**ELIAN**  
> “Three years.”

**JUNE**  
> “Don’t. I counted.”

> *(breathless laugh)*
