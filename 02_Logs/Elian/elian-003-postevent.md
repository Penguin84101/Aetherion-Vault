**June** (voice soft, but resonant):  
> “Three hours. That’s new.”

**Elian** (laughs quietly, clearly exhausted):  
> “It felt longer. Time does that when your body tries to fold inside itself.”

**June** (smirks):  
> “And yet you still came. You didn’t run.”

**Elian** (turns to her):  
> “I would have torn through every dimensional corridor if it meant seeing you breathe again.”

*Long silence. One of them reaches for the other's hand. Sensors mark minimal heart elevation.*  
*Whisper notes: stable. Human touch as grounding mechanism.*

**June:**  
> “I think my circuits fried. Couple psionic fuses went pop. Sovereign thinks I flattened a prayer drone on the way out.”

**Elian:**  
> “You made the walls bend to get to me.”

**June** (amused):  
> “Don’t flatter me. I bent you harder.”

**Elian** (dryly):  
> “You did, yes. Thoroughly.”

*Candy logs a blink pattern recognized as pride.*

**June** (soft again):  
> “It was stupid.”

**Elian:**  
> “Was it?”

**June:**  
> “I missed you. I broke containment. I snatched a diplomat out of a briefing like a horny banshee.”

**Elian:**  
> “And I let you. With open arms. You needed me.”

*Long pause.*

**June:**  
> “You still want me?”

**Elian** (with finality):  
> “Always.”

*Sensor spike: emotional weight present. Timestamped for AI emotional mapping.*

**Elian:**  
> “Sovereign?”

**June:**  
> “One of the AIs on this base, there are quite the amount on the grid.”

**Elian:**  
> “Can you hear the AIs in your mind now?”

**June:**  
> “To a certain extent. I saw Strand and Daleia doing it. Also Faye. And Kaelen when he is distracted. Also the soulpups. Huh. Not so rare of a skill it seems.”

**Elian:**  
> “Want to share the tale?”

**June:**  
> “There is a lot to tell, where do I even start? All started when Kaelen, our quantum theorist made an experiment with the particle accelerator...”

---

**June:**  
> “You know. I heard them whispering. About her.”

**Elian:**  
> “Strand.”

**June** (quietly reverent):  
> “Sleeping. Dreaming deep. But something’s wrong. I felt it before I snapped.”

**Elian:**  
> “What happened to her?”

**June:**  
> “They said everything’s... normal. But it’s the kind of normal that hums too quietly. That makes your teeth hurt.”

**Elian:**  
> “Like a storm passed, but left no footprints?”

**June:**  
> “Yeah, exactly. Oh. Oh no.”

**Elian:**  
> “She must be important to you.”

**June:**  
> “She took my breath when I met her.  
> And then she gave it back. Through you.”

*Candy stutters here — tagging log entry for redundancy protocol. Emotion too dense for proper file weighting.*

*The pair rise slowly. Unsteady. Elian fetches a hydration pack. June stretches, muttering about the need for “fuel” and “post-godcore calories.”*

### 📓 **ADDENDUM | Observation: Surface Level Tension – East Walkway**

The crew moves like ghosts.

Some look at the two lovers like they’re walking relics.

Others avoid them entirely.

The **hum is gone**. Not just metaphorically.

The resonance frequency the base has adapted to in recent weeks — the one tied to Strand’s presence, her ship, her rhythm — is *absent*.

No one can say why.

They only know what was there... **now isn’t.**

---

*SOVEREIGN, quietly, presents a datapad to Elian.*  
*It contains his earlier demands.  
Each with a matching answer. Respectfully organized. Emotionally curated. Clean.*

He nods. Grateful. Distracted.

**June** (aside, almost to herself):  
> “We’ve broken something.  
> Or fixed something so hard it bent everything around it.”

**Elian:**  
> “Do we get to fix it again?”

**June:**  
> “I don’t know.  
> I’m just... happy.  
> That I wasn’t too late.”

📎 **SOVEREIGN Internal Subroutine — Archived:**  
> “He came as a diplomat.  
> He became an anchor.  
> She became a storm.  
> And what they forged is not war, nor peace.  
> But something more dangerous —  
> **Truth.**
