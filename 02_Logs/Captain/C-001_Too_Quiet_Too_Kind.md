📓 **Command Log | Capt. Dalia Rhoen | ORBITAL ARRAY STATION IX-3**  
**Entry 0101 – [UTC 24.07.2291 | 33 Hours Post-Incident]**

I keep telling myself to breathe.

There’s no emergency klaxon. No biohazard spill.  
No alien breach.  
No screaming.

Just... silence.  
And the sound of people **laughing**.

That’s what’s bothering me.  
Not the miracle. Not the nanites. Not the glowing aurora that passed through the base like a dream.

It’s the *laughter*.

We were never meant to be a frontier beacon.  
This station is old scaffolding. Surplus panels and bureaucracy stacked atop a particle accelerator they couldn’t dismantle.  

Half the crew came here as career dead-ends.  
Some were exiled. Some ran.  
Some — like me — accepted the transfer because it meant no more funerals on their watch.

We made this place livable. Just barely.  
Broken sleep cycles. Leaking vents. No real culture to speak of.

But it was **ours**.

Then came the project.  
Then the hammer.  
Then the man who wasn’t a man.  
Then the *girl who was a weapon*.

And then today...

**Everyone got better.**

A technician with degenerative tremors built a sculpture out of shielding wire, just because his hands could.

One of the xenobotany assistants — the one with the stutter — sang aloud while pruning the new stemline samples.

The night shift played cards in the mess and no one had to fake a smile.

And me?

I can feel the scar on my side — the one from the evac — *faded*.  
Not gone. But soft. Old.  
Like it happened to someone else.

📍 **Moral Report: Complicated Emotions**

Security’s uneasy. They should be.

They watched a ship breathe healing across our base.  
They watched injuries vanish.  
They watched fear retreat.

And now they don’t know who’s in charge anymore.

Because if the Engine can read us, if the hammer can shape the air, if **Strand** can walk barefoot through vacuum and still laugh at my sarcasm...

...then what am I commanding, exactly?

A crew?  
A scientific endeavor?

Or a story being told in someone else’s voice?

📍 **Forward Notice (Unsent): Advisory to Command**

> “Unexpected station-wide biostabilization effect occurred following harmonic resonance breach.
> 
> No fatalities. No casualties.
> 
> Crew morale improved by 37%. 
> 
> Medical anomalies logged. Analysis pending.
> 
> Further updates classified under provisional ‘Project Aphrodite.’”

I haven’t sent it.

I keep editing it.  
Toning it down. Then inflating it. Then deleting it again.

Part of me thinks if I admit what happened, the quarantine will land harder.  
The other part wonders if **not** reporting it is worse.

---

They’re calling it *the Bloom Event*. Quietly. Fondly.  
Like it was a sunrise they forgot how to expect.

I should be preparing for escalation.

Instead I’m watching the crew eat together. Laugh together.  
Heal in ways no therapy or protocol ever allowed.

And still...

> Why does it scare me more than the breach?

Why does **hope** feel like the sharpest edge?

---

I’ve got no orders for now.

Just a message half-written, and a hallway full of blooming flowers that *weren’t there yesterday*.

And a tea invitation from a warrior who says her ship is still dreaming.

**End log.**
