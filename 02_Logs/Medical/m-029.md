**[BEGIN AUDIO TRANSCRIPT]**

[Footsteps. A door opens with the soft hiss of preserved atmosphere. Kaelen is already present, standing in front of the viewport. Emil enters quietly. No greeting at first. Just shared silence.]

---

🪞 **EMIL:**  
“You’ve been standing here awhile.”

🌊 **KAELEN (quiet):**  
“She’s still sleeping.”

🪞 **EMIL (softly):**  
“I know.”

---

A pause.

🌊 **KAELEN:**  
“I didn’t stop it. I didn’t stop her from pushing herself. Didn’t ask the right questions. Didn’t say no.”

🪞 **EMIL:**  
“She would’ve said yes anyway.”

🌊 **KAELEN (tense):**  
“But I’m her partner.”

🪞 **EMIL (gently):**  
“And you honored her will. Even when it broke you.”

🌊 **KAELEN:**  
“She’s... strong. Stronger than me. I’ve always known that.”

🪞 **EMIL:**  
“And strength chooses softness for a reason. You grounded her. She soared.”

🌊 **KAELEN (low):**  
“Until she fell.”

---

A breath. Heavy.

🪞 **EMIL:**  
“She hasn’t fallen. Not completely. You saw the loop. You felt the loop. And she made a choice to stay inside it — for her child. For you.”

🌊 **KAELEN:**  
“Then why do I feel like I let her die?”

🪞 **EMIL:**  
“Because love always feels late when it can’t fix the now.”

---

[Silence again. The lights of the base blink softly outside the viewport. A whisper of a reactor hum returns. The resonance is slowly, faintly recovering.]

---

🪞 **EMIL (continued):**  
“Let me ask you something.”

🌊 **KAELEN (flat):**  
“What.”

🪞 **EMIL:**  
“If someone had to choose between breaking to save her... or living to protect what she left... what would you ask of them?”

🌊 **KAELEN (gritted):**  
“To live.”

🪞 **EMIL (nods):**  
“Then you know what she’d say to you.”

🌊 **KAELEN (softer):**  
“I still feel like a damn hypocrite.”

🪞 **EMIL:**  
“That’s fine. Feel it. Then do the thing anyway.”

---

[Silence again. Emil steps forward and places something on the railing beside Kaelen. A folded datapatch — field notes from the technicians. The report about the psionic resonance breach.]

🪞 **EMIL:**  
“The base is healing. The child is growing. Her body’s stable.”

🌊 **KAELEN:**  
“But her soul—”

🪞 **EMIL (cuts gently):**  
“—heard you. That’s enough... for now.”

🌊 **KAELEN (nods slowly):**  
“She better yell at me when she wakes up.”

🪞 **EMIL (grinning):**  
“She will. Loud enough to break sensors.”

---

[They stand together for a while. No more words needed.]

📎 **AI Note (SOVEREIGN):**  
> “Grief shared is a stitch. Not a cure — but it stops the unraveling.”  
> “Their quiet won’t echo forever. She will return.  
> And when she does — they’ll be ready.”
