plot_hooks:
  - Definitive confirmation that hCG is the transformation lock-in trigger.
  - Establishes a timeline and narrow window for permanent rewrite.
  - Kaelen’s annotations reveal mounting stress and guilt.
  - Suggests quiet dread behind the base’s calm surface.
  - Foreshadows emotional fallout if even one intern is pregnant.

📓 **Log Entry | Med-AI HYGEIA**  
**Cross-Analysis Requested by: Dr. Kaelen Rho**  
**Timestamp: [2291-07-22 | 0547 hours]**

---

📎 **Query:**  
“Cross-reference existing nanite behavior from STRAND-vessel incident (Deck C) against known hormonal triggers for long-term morphological stabilization.”

📎 **Result:**

🧬 **Hormonal Response Matrix | Tardigrade-Class Rewrite Nanites – Generation Unknown**

| Hormone                        | Lock-in Effect | Notes                                                |
|-------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Luteinizing Hormone (LH)      | ❌ No           | Moderate fluctuation during puberty – no effect     |
| Follicle-Stimulating Hormone  | ❌ No           | Peaks do not initiate structural anchoring          |
| Estradiol/Testosterone Shift  | ❌ No           | Readjusts nanite equilibrium but not permanence     |
| Oxytocin / Norepinephrine     | ❌ No           | Elevated during arousal – does not anchor rewrite   |
| **Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG)** | ✅ Yes  | **Lock confirmed. Rewrite stabilizes if present**   |

📎 **Interpretation (annotated by Dr. Rho):**

> _“This is it. Not identity. Not puberty. Not intent. Just… fertilization.”_

> _“We didn’t trigger the rewrite with thought. We triggered it with biology.”_

> _“All it takes is one surge of hCG. The body stops listening to nanite reversion. It anchors. It decides.”_

---

📎 **Secondary Data Tags:**

- Projected duration of nanite viability: 14–16 hours from original exposure.
- Approximate exposure window overlap with Deck C population: 82% likely overlap during cloud event.
- Intern hormonal ranges still within flux.

📎 **Anomaly Flagged in System Logs (non-medical):**  
> *“Unassigned transient resonance spike at 0427 hours.”*

- Flagged retroactively by Med-AI correlation layer.  
- Origin: unclear. Suspected overlap with onboard Genesis Engine signature.

> _Dr. Rho annotation: “This… might’ve been the first one. The moment it happened. One heartbeat out of sync with every other.”_

---

📎 **Recommendations:**  
- Monitor all affected individuals for hCG onset.  
- Immediate med-lock of pregnancy-capable subjects pending confirmation.  
- Request psychological consultation to pre-empt trauma mitigation.

🧠 **Doctor's Final Note:**

> _“The base hasn’t erupted in panic because it doesn’t know what’s at stake.”_  
> _“But I do. And I don’t think I’m ready.”_

**Log Ends.**
