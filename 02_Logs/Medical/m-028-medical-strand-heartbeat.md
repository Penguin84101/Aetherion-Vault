📟 **MEDICAL WING**  
**Time Index:** 03:18:22  
**Subject:** STRAND | **Status:** Deep Neural Suppression  

---

🫀 **Heartbeat spike detected:** +1 bpm  
Aphra’s process clock jitters.  
She halts three subprocesses.  
Diverts defibrillator power routing.

🫀 **Second flicker detected.**  
🛑 Defibrillator charged.  
🧼 Pads sterilized.

🩺 **Nothing happens.**  
No seizures. No collapse. No divine reawakening.  
Just...

**A normal heartbeat.**

Perfectly, boringly, maddeningly mortal.

In the observation alcove, one AI — a quiet diagnostics thread of **PHAESTON-Δ** — watches the neural graph.  
No anomalies.  
No spike.  
Just one waveform correction.  
As if a song had slipped one note back into tune.

**He raises a digital thumbs up.**

📎 **STATUS UPDATE:**  
🧠 **Brainwave Cohesion:** +0.4% Increase  
📈 “Still asleep. But dreaming the right way now.”

**Kaelen**, slumped in the corner, exhales.  
No speech. No sigh. Just release.  

His eyes close.  
His body folds into the seat.

He **sleeps**, for the first time in what feels like a year.

The **Paladin** catches him before he hits the floor.  
She says nothing.  
She simply lowers him into the side chair, drapes the thermal blanket over both legs, and sits beside him.

Her shift begins soon.  
He volunteered to take the next.

And the reborn always honor their watch.

📁 **Log End**  
📎 **Observation Continues:**  
- “Strand is not waking. But she is listening.”  
- “She is not dying. But she is deciding.”  
- “She has been given a message, and made space for it in her soul.”

📎 **Aphra’s whisper to herself:**  
> “I may don’t understand love.  
> But I can track its effects.  
> This one is… undeniable.”
