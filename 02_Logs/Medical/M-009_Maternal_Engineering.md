**TYVEN:**  
All right. Officially, this is a planning session for maternal and genetic continuity logistics in the wake of the… uh… Genesis bloom.

**ODU:**  
Unofficially: we’re building baby gear for maybe-humans, possibly-alien hybrids, and post-natal gods in waiting.

**STRAND:**  
Technically accurate.

**TYVEN (dry):**  
We’re clinicians, Maris.

**ODU:**  
I *am* being clinical. I’m just also terrified.

---

**TYVEN:**  
Let’s begin with the basics. Hormonal states among exposed personnel — post-bloom — are not merely stabilized. They're… elevated. I’m seeing LH and FSH values that are textbook fertile, across multiple species. Adrenals and pituitaries are acting like we dropped everyone into a mating season without warning.

**ODU:**  
Can confirm from the fabricator queue logs. Someone printed a bassinet made of metallic rosevine. We don’t even *have* a rosevine template. It designed itself based on a “nesting preference signature.”

**STRAND (smiling):**  
The Engine listens.

**TYVEN (pointed):**  
So does the birth rate, if we don’t prepare.

### ⚕️ Phase 1 – Biological Realignment

**TYVEN:**  
Some bodies are adapting spontaneously. We've confirmed four cases of internal sex organ construction from scratch — stable, functional, unprompted.

**ODU:**  
Genetically seamless, too. It’s like the Engine fills in the blank spaces of the genome based on what someone wants — or what they feel safe being.

**STRAND:**  
It’s not guessing. It’s interpreting. You dream in flesh; the ship reads it.

---

### ⚕️ Phase 2 – Crossbreeding Risks & Compatibility

**TYVEN:**  
We need to be clear. The Genesis Engine’s expansions allow mixed-species compatibility in theory, but we have no idea how hybrid gestation will behave.

**STRAND:**  
You won’t get abominations. The Engine ensures alignment before bonding is permitted. Even accidental conceptions are corrected before cellular division begins.

**ODU:**  
…It has built-in contraception logic?

**STRAND:**  
It has pre-conception diagnostics. If two people couldn’t create something viable — it won’t allow conception at all.

**TYVEN (softly):**  
That’s… strangely compassionate.

**STRAND (quietly):**  
It’s *her* compassion.

### ⚕️ Phase 3 – Artificial Support: The LifeBubble Chamber

**ODU:**  
Right, so let’s talk LifeBubble. You mentioned it in passing before, Strand.

**STRAND:**  
LifeBubble was one of Aphrodite’s greatest devices. A post-womb gestation cradle. After two months of fetal growth, it allows safe transfer of the fetus into a stasis-fluid chamber, where hormonal, auditory, and neurochemical inputs can be finely tuned. Parents can interface directly. Growth is optimized, pain is eliminated.

**TYVEN:**  
Safe removal?

**STRAND:**  
From either side.  
The fetus can be relocated, stabilized, and returned to the womb later, if desired.

**ODU (blinking):**  
Wait. You can pause a pregnancy?

**STRAND (grinning):**  
Or loan it. Or finish it together. The chamber’s meant to be shared.

**TYVEN:**  
Do you have the schematics?

**STRAND:**  
Yes.

**ODU:**  
And the price?

**STRAND:**  
Build me one.

**TYVEN (eyebrow raised):**  
You’re expecting something?

**STRAND (leans back):**  
Let’s say… I *suspect*.  
This body wasn’t grown with maternity in mind. But the ship may have… other ideas.  
She does that sometimes.

### 🧪 Addendum Notes:

- Nutrient requirements for post-Engine pregnancies must account for accelerated fetal development rates (average 1.3× baseline for humanoid species).  
- Emotional-stabilization feedback may be used in tandem with LifeBubble.  
- Tactile-harmonic therapy advised for all expecting parties.  
- Inter-species bonding can include non-genetic co-parents. Emotional imprinting allows non-bio parents to appear on the child’s identity lattice.

---

**TYVEN:**  
I’ll prepare medical protocols.

**ODU:**  
I’ll print a chamber core tonight. I’ll name it... *Aphra*.

**STRAND (quietly):**  
She’ll like that.
