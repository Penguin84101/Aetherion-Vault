**\[Recording begins.]**

**TYVEN** *(muttering while pacing):*  
“…three days.  
We have three days to complete a generational medical first, clear post-lockdown inventories, reconstruct a soul-safe gestation pod, and not die of media backlash the moment a peacock diplomat steps off his ship.”

\[She grabs a mug of something thick, half-caffeinated.]

**TYVEN:**  
“Aphra, how’s the fetal sync?”

**APHRA** *(calmly):*  
“Strong. Rhythmic. I believe the child is aware. It dreams... and recognizes warmth.”

**TYVEN** *(quietly):*  
“Good.  
I want Strand to wake up from this and have something to hold.  
I want Kaelen to stop trying to act like he’s fine.”

\[She tosses a data-slate down.]

“Regeneration kits just got tripled in the drop manifest.  
Either someone in logistics thinks we’re cloning limbs…  
or they overheard the ten-hour myth.”

“I swear if I have to hand out spine glue to a diplomat, I’ll lose my license.”

\[Beat.]

“We are going to make this work.  
Because gods may be rising...  
but we still have to keep them alive.”

\[She exhales. The light behind her pulses.]
