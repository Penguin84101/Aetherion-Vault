### > Event Trigger:

Ensign Dale Verin, while attempting to request “slightly taller with better cardio efficiency,” accessed an **unlisted preset** buried deep in the legacy archive of the Genesis Engine.

He **misclicked**.

He **did not read** the full prompt.

He **confirmed** the preset titled:

> ✨ "Mallcore Paladin: Radiant Wrath Protocol" ✨  
> [Subnote: Style package includes *“Justice Heels”*, *“Flame Wings”*, and *“Sword of the Moon-Reckoner”*]  
> [Flavor text: “Because saving the galaxy should look hot.”]

---

### > Transformation Results:

- **Height:** +23 cm  
- **Stat cap:** Released  
- **Legwear:** Neon-gold thigh-high heels with inexplicable anti-grav stability  
- **Voice modulation:** Echoing with holy synths  
- **Makeup:** Self-generating, waterproof, battle-rated  
- **Weapon:** Glowing crystalline sword fused to DNA via *Heart-link™*  
- **Cape:** Animated. Sentient. Judgy.

### > Verbal Log: Dale (now identifying as “Daleia of the Velvet Dawn”)

> “I feel... powerful. Like I owe someone justice.  
> And also... like I could kill a god with a hair whip.  
> Did I just parry a maintenance drone *by posing*?!”

### 💬 Observations & Reactions:

**Dr. Mirelle Sato (arriving at scene):**

> “Oh, Dale…”  
> (sighs)  
> “That’s a preset from the Aphrodite prototype trials. Pre-ethics review.  
> It runs on *narrative flair* and *unresolved emotional trauma*.”  
> (cape snaps at her)  
> “Also, the cape’s gonna keep judging you until you apologize to your mother.”

**Dr. Kaelen Rho (radio, exhausted):**

> “If anything explodes, I’m docking pay.  
> Also, someone please find the setting that disables the slow-motion filter.  
> It’s draining the power grid.”

**Strand (laughing, still restrained):**

> “Oh yes. Peak nostalgia. That preset *slayed* during the ’88 Transmart Enlightenment Wave.  
> It came with a karaoke theme. Try yelling *‘I am the final glitter!’* during combat!”

### > Genesis Engine Notes:

- Daleia attempted to de-transform. **Engine refused.** Cited:  
  > “Narrative arc not yet fulfilled.”

- Sword emits a noise **like a choir screaming into a vocoder**.  
  Station AI avoids that corridor.

- Emotional responses to Daleia’s presence:  
  - 37% awe  
  - 42% envy  
  - 21% inappropriate curiosity

📋 **Mitigation Status:**

- **Sword:** Magnetically affixed to ceiling panel (temporary containment)  
- **Heels:** Fused to skeletal structure. Surgical removal inadvisable.  
- **Support Group:** “Unrequested Deity Ascension” added to next Tuesday’s agenda.
