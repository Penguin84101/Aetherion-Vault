**FAYE:**  
I’m not in trouble, technically. Not anymore.  
Dr. Rho just... said my access is suspended for seventy-two hours and then muttered something about writing ethical guidelines on heatstroke prevention in zero-G romance zones.

**STRAND** *(laughs softly):*  
He’s fond of structure. It comforts him.

**FAYE:**  
It used to comfort me.  
The way things had names. Boxes. Categories.  
Now...  
I don’t know. Everything feels louder. Brighter. More.

**STRAND:**  
That tends to happen.  
The body expands. So does what you think it’s allowed to feel.  
She — Aphrodite — would’ve called it *congruence drift*.  
When mind and matter rediscover alignment in a form not previously considered.

**FAYE:**  
You talk like you’ve done this before.

**STRAND:**  
Not this exact path.  
But I’ve worn many shapes.  
My birthplace didn’t bother with permanence. Or gender. Or species templates.  
DNA was a resource, not a prison.  
Bodies were just different verses in a larger poem.

**FAYE** *(after a pause):*  
Cam said I looked beautiful.  
Before the door kicked in.  
And I *felt* beautiful.  
I’ve never felt that before — not at home, not in my old skin.  
And now it’s going to fade.  
I can already feel little things resetting. My hands. My jaw.

**STRAND:**  
It doesn’t have to.

**FAYE** *(softly):*  
...What?

**STRAND:**  
The nanites you encountered were mild. Autonomous. Legacy-coded.  
But my facilities contain deeper systems.  
Bound to Aphrodite’s primary intent.

She never required pregnancy to offer permanence.  
That’s just one trigger — a symbol, not a limit.  
There are other ways to ask.  
Ways that don’t involve hormones or accidents.

**FAYE:**  
You’re saying... I could *stay* this way?  
Without... locking myself with a kid?

**STRAND:**  
Yes.  
If that’s what you want.  
Not out of impulse. Or fear.  
But because the shape *sings* to you.

**FAYE** *(almost a whisper):*  
I don’t even know what that means.

**STRAND:**  
You will.  
And when you do... the Engine listens.

**FAYE:**  
Why are you telling me this?

**STRAND** *(smiling):*  
Because I think you and Cam are adorable.  
And I think this might be what *she* wanted all along.  
Not just survival. Not just biology.  
But love as a choice of form.  
Desire that writes its own language in the flesh.

**FAYE** *(quietly):*  
...What happens if I say yes?

**STRAND:**  
Then the ship will know.  
And so will you.
