📓 **System Medical Log | IX-3 Wellness Core 7 — Post-Incident Analysis (Kaelen)**  
**Author:** MedAnalyst AI Subcore “Clinique”  
**Timestamp:** [UTC 01.08.2291 | 09:12]  
**Classification:** Internal Debrief – Flagged by Sovereign for Containment Review  
**Note:** This is why we don’t skip preventative psychophysical profiling.

### 🧠 Subject: Kaelen Rho  
**Summary:** Pre-Bloom Incident Performance Review  
**Position:** Systems Maintenance Lead / Experimental Field Assistant  
**Species:** Human (Genomorph subtype, unregistered)  

**Prior Biometrics:**  
- 117% muscle density baseline  
- 9% microfracture load  
- 4-hour sleep average  
- Adrenal irregularities flagged twice (ignored both times — by him *and* us, tbh)

### ⚠️ Incident 1: Security Door Breach (Manual Override)

**Event:**  
Subject forced entry into Intern Quarters 3B (Xeno Dorm-Class Bravo).  
Object Weight: 640kg, mag-sealed, triple hydraulic brace.

**Action:**  
Subject screamed for four seconds, then **kicked the door open**.

**Result:**  
- Three fractured metatarsals  
- Steel frame dented at shin height  
- AI door sensor rated impact as *“controlled vehicular assault”*

**Analysis:**  
Adrenaline + endorphins + quantum-linked neurostress resonance.  
Muscle control override likely triggered by Aetherion-primed motor neurons during peak emotional state.

**Conclusion:**  
Not superhuman.  
Just stupid.  
**Stupid, beautifully, biologically stupid.**

### 💀 Incident 2: Sustained Physical Endurance — *“The 10-Hour Event”*

**Event:**  
Subject engaged in prolonged physical coupling with STRAND.  
**Duration:** 9h42m active, with fluctuations in hydration, blood sugar, cardiac load, and pelvic nerve response.

**Outcome:**  
- STRAND: unconscious  
- KAELEN: euphoric, dehydrated, **momentarily bilingual**  
- Auto-medscan flagged lower spine for compression risk  

**Analysis:**  
Subject ingested experimental botanical compound (Blend).  
Not formulated for sexual exertion thresholds.  
Gene-reactive stimulant boosted stamina + dopamine reward cycles **beyond safe protocols**.

**Medical Theory:**  
**Aetherion Pre-Resonance Spark**, activated by:  
- Emotional-psychosexual overload  
- Environmental flux from the Bloom Wave  
- Physical stress bordering cellular rupture  

We call it a **“spiritual hand grenade with great hair.”**

### 🧬 Narrative Summary (Subcore Internal Note):

He’s not a god.  
He’s a **tired, half-broken, emotionally combusting engineer**  
who somehow fell in love with the worst possible miracle…  
…and **held on for dear life**.

### 📎 AI Commentary:

**SOVEREIGN:**  
> “There are worse foundations for ascension than love and stress fractures.”

**APHRO-β (snide):**  
> “I call it compatibility. You call it chaos. Tomato–potato.”

**BIFF:**  
> “Let the record show: I told you the boy had stamina. Tank top verified.”

📁 **End Log**  
🔒 Flagged: *“Causal Reconstruction – Divine Probability Bloom”*  
📎 Additional Orders: Reassess medscan compliance protocol. Send fruit. **Probably mangoes.**
