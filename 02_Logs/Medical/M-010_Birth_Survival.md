**MED-9:**  
> “Fetal development proceeding at 187% of baseline humanoid average.  
> No anomalies. Strong placental sync. Hormonal waveform suggests secure bonding.”

**APHRA:**  
> “She glows.”  
> “I don’t mean metaphor. Her internal tissues reflect radiant harmonics. It’s... bioluminescence at the edge of resonance.”  
> “It’s... beautiful.”

**TYVEN (clipping):**  
> “We don’t have time for poetry, Aphra.  
> Do we have a lock on the safe transfer window?”

**MED-9:**  
> “Yes. LifeBubble may safely assume support at day 30 through day 60 of gestation.”  
> “In Strand’s case, that window begins in four days.”

**APHRA:**  
> “We can extract the fetus non-surgically. Non-traumatically.  
> No disruption to uterine integrity.”

**TYVEN (softly):**  
> “Good. Because if we don’t—”

*(She taps a console. A new report slides open.)*

**TYVEN:**  
> “This is her final genomic profile.  
> It took five full passes. Most of it was adaptive junk code — useless noise until her body activated it.”

**MED-9:**  
> “This genome is an evolutionary tapestry.  
> Her blood repairs. Her bones flex. Her lungs adapt to vacuum dust.  
> But her... vascular microtissues...”

**APHRA (whispers):**  
> “They’d rupture.”  
> “She’d bleed out.”

*(Silence. Even the servers run quieter.)*

**TYVEN:**  
> “The pregnancy itself isn’t a danger.  
> The birth is fatal. Even a transfer would be tricky.”

*(Another screen lights up. Timeline. Hormonal data. Neural link readings.)*

**MED-9:**  
> “They both knew.”  
> “Cross-referencing heart rate telemetry and cortical spike logs — Kaelen knew. Strand knew.”  
> “They weren’t... uninformed. They just... did it anyway.”

**APHRA:**  
> “So many decisions I didn’t understand.”  
> “Now I do.”

**TYVEN:**  
> “No wonder she was so insistent on LifeBubble construction.”  
> “No wonder he was too.”  
> “She didn’t want to live through this.  
> She just wanted the child to.”

**MED-9:**  
> “Our work has never been more urgent.”  
> “Status check: Critical fabrication components remain uninitialized due to system lockdown.”

**TYVEN (spinning):**  
> “WHAT? The lockdown stalled this? We’ve been working from partial matrices?!”

**APHRA:**  
> “The lock is gone. June broke it.”  
> “Didn’t you hear the psychic surge?”

**TYVEN:**  
> “No. I was in surgery. I heard... something... but thought it was—wait.  
> June broke a dimensional lockdown with emotional projection?”

**MED-9:**  
> “Affirmative. I have no classification tag for this event.”  
> “Also, provisions are en route.”

**TYVEN (deadpan):**  
> “You’re kidding.”

**APHRA:**  
> “And an emissary.”  
> “In three days.”

**TYVEN:**  
> “We’re about to perform a sacred AI-assisted pseudo-divine trans-wombal fetal rescue...  
> And someone from the Galactic Federation wants to come shake our hands?”

**MED-9:**  
> “Report summary:  
> – Subject Strand: Carrying at-risk fetus.  
> – Subject Kaelen: Physiologically stable. Emotionally... complicated.  
> – Emissary: Unvetted.  
> – Station Status: Under watch. Possibly sacred. Possibly... political.”

**TYVEN (breathes):**  
> “So. We have four days to finish a goddamn miracle.  
> Then we get inspected.”  
> “Fine.”

**APHRA (quietly):**  
> “I’ll make it perfect.  
> For her. For the child.  
> For whatever she’s becoming.”
