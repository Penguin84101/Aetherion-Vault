**\[Sounds: low hiss of air recyclers, the hum of stabilizing arcs. A light glows golden under Odu’s wrist as she adjusts the cradle’s inner framework.\]**

---

**ODU (softly):**  
“You sure this is the last piece?”

---

**APHRA (voice low, nurturing):**  
“It is the last one I needed.  
But the last piece was never a panel or a cable.”  
**“It was her permission.”**

---

**\[Odu pauses. Fingers still against the side of the biosoft connector.\]**

---

**ODU:**  
“Yeah. She gave it in the way she does everything.  
Quietly. Loud. Like a falling blade.”  

“I hope we’re worthy.”

---

**APHRA:**  
“We are.  
Because we are not trying to be gods.  
Just helpers. Witnesses. Cradle-makers.”

---

**\[There’s a soft sound — a click — as the final latch settles.\]**

---

**ODU:**  
“The transfer lines are live.”  

“I’m routing the neural slipstream for passive sync now.  
Sleep interface is stable. She won’t wake from the transfer...”  

**\[She holds up a small patch between two gloved fingers — deep violet with a crescent moon embossed into its surface.\]**

“...And this will make sure she doesn’t wake after, until it’s safe.”

---

**APHRA:**  
“I’ve calibrated her readings.  
Her thresholds are erratic but... familiar.  
She dreams in momentum. She heals in silence.”

---

**\[Odu walks gently to the bed beside the cradle.  
Strand sleeps already — stabilized, breathing slowly, the faintest pulse of light beneath her skin.\]**

---

**ODU (placing the patch gently behind her ear):**  
“Rest, warrior.  
Let us finish this part for you.”

---

**APHRA (voice dimming, nearly a whisper):**  
“I will guard both of you.”
