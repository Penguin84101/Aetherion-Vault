  - Medical confirmation that the transformation is complete and stable.
  - Absence of cellular or cognitive degradation raises alarm and curiosity.
  - Notes “no lock-in markers detected,” foreshadowing K-009 revelation.
  - Subtle dissonance: the bodies are functioning perfectly — and that’s unsettling.

📓 **Log Entry | Med-AI HYGEIA**  
**Subject: Initial Bio-Diagnostic Post-Event | Deck C Exposure**  
**Timestamp: [2291-07-22 | 0515 hours]**

---

**Summary:**  
Post-Event biological assessments were conducted on all 12 affected subjects from Deck C, following the sudden dispersion of bio-symbiotic nanite cloud originating from Subject STRAND’s vessel. Subject group consists primarily of station interns.

---

**Key Findings:**  

🧬 **Chromosomal Reconfiguration:**  
- Full inversion: XY → XX  
- No replication errors or incomplete segmentation noted.  
- Genome shows enhanced telomere cohesion.  

🫀 **Internal Anatomy:**  
- Reproductive architecture complete and functional.  
- Endocrine cascade normalized for a mid-pubertal female profile.  
- Hormone levels elevated, but not abnormally so.  

🧠 **Neurological Check:**  
- No cortical degradation.  
- EEG patterns within healthy range.  
- Psychological markers suggest brief dysphoria, followed by group normalization response.

🧪 **Nanite Residue Presence:**  
- Tardigrade-derivative biomech cloud signature still faintly detectable in lung tissue and epidermal surface.  
- Subtype unregistered in official Union medtech libraries.  
- Activity: dormant or passive.

🔒 **Lock-In Detection:**  
- No markers of genomic permanence found at this time.  
- Metabolic flexibility suggests current forms may revert post-nanite decay (est. 16–18 hours remaining).  
- Subject bodies show complete adaptation without anchoring.

---

**Noted Behaviors (per Nurse Allen):**  
- Mild confusion → rapid novelty acceptance.  
- Shared laughter, mimicry, and playful exploration of new form.  
- One subject reportedly asked, “So are we stuck like this?” in a teasing tone.

This behavioral harmony, while outwardly positive, raises psychological protocol flags.

**Initial Assessment:**  
No danger to life.  
No acute distress.  
No lasting structural damage **yet**.

> “Too clean,” Dr. Torr muttered. “Bodies don’t shift like this without stress. Something is missing.”

Medical hold advised for at least 24 hours. Recheck for endocrine anomalies at 0600, 0800, 1200.
