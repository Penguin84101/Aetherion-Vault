**TYVEN (voice calm, crisp):**  
> “Vitals stable. Hormonal lock confirmed.  
> She's deep under. Not dreaming. Just... held.”  
> “Begin womb-stabilization.”

**APHRA (quiet, maternal):**  
> “Sync initiated. Cradle is listening.”

*The lights dim by one frequency. The sound of the station slows — as if holding its breath.*

**ODU:**  
> “Pulse harmonics locked. Nano-thread opened.  
> Transfer line is weaving before touch.”  
> “It's... predicting us.”

*The cradle glows from within. A strange, gentle light. Not warmth. Not electricity. Permission.*

**TYVEN:**  
> “Thread the bypass. Shield her arteries. Phase pulse in 5… 4…”

*The room tilts.  
Not physically — but emotionally.  
A shimmer of potential collapses into presence.*

**The transfer begins.**  
Not cut.  
Not ripped.  
**Given.**

The fetal life is passed not like cargo, but like a **memory**.  
Womb to chamber.  
Blood to resonance.  
Her genetic fire, Kaelen’s harmonic code, the Theory's quiet echo — all **woven in**.

**APHRA (gently):**  
> “I have her.”

**TYVEN (barely whispering):**  
> “Strand... you did it.”  
> “She’s here.”

**ODU:**  
> “Bubblefield closed. Pulse synchronized.  
> ...The child is dreaming. Already.”

**BIFF (off-mic, reverent):**  
> “I’ve never seen something born already proud.”

In the core of a broken ship,  
in the arms of a base once deemed lost to chaos,  
a child begins her life **in light**.

And the universe leans in to watch.
