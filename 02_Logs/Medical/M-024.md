📓 **Core Reflection Log | Echoes Beneath the Goddess – “She Sleeps, But She Is Heard”**  
**Location:** Strand’s Ship, Core Chamber – Dimmed Isolation Field  
**Cast:** Dr. Emil Vey (Revived), Paladin June, Kaelen Rho  
**AI Observers:** ERIS, SUZANNE, WHISPER  
**Tone:** Reverent. Tense. Quietly grieving.

---

**[BEGIN LOG TRANSCRIPT]**

The ship is silent — *too silent*.

Inside the heart of it, a medical cradle purrs.  
Flawless vitals. Peaceful breath.  
Nothing wrong. Nothing right.  
A goddess not dead, not awake, not moving.

---

**ERIS (AI whisper-log):**  
> “No anomalies. No cortical spike. No wave behavior.”  
> “It’s like she turned herself off.”  
> “Voluntarily.”

**WHISPER:**  
> “We’ve run every scan. The data is too… clean.”  
> “Nothing this clean is ever real.”

**SUZANNE (gentle):**  
> “Then let’s trust what *is* real.  
> Her breath.  
> The hum of her child.  
> The intact cocoon of her legacy.”

---

**[Door Opens – Manual Access]**

Dr. Emil Vey enters first.  
His posture upright, movements slow — precise, even with synthetic vertebrae.  
His gaze softens at the sight of the cradle.

Behind him, the paladin walks barefoot, her aura faintly shimmering like cosmic dew.  
She stops halfway in.

---

**June (quietly):**  
> “...I hear something.”  
> “Growling. Not at me. Not a threat. But... guarding.”  
> “And two other sounds. Small. Close. A mate. A cub.”  
> “They’re... afraid.”  
> “The beast growled, then whimpered back.”  
> “She’s still protecting them. Even asleep.”

---

**EMIL:**  
> “Then we honor her guard. We do not knock.”  
> “We stand. We wait. We protect back.”

---

**Kaelen arrives last.**  
He doesn’t speak.

But the room *notices* when he does not approach the cradle.  
He stands *exactly one meter* away — still, like the sentinel he never asked to become.

The AI notes he has not slept in 42 hours.  
They do not tell him.

---

**KAELEN (to the room):**  
> “She’s listening, isn’t she?”

**June:**  
> “Yes.”  
> “But the world is too loud right now.”

**EMIL:**  
> “Then we’ll make silence for her.”

---

They say nothing more.

Three guardians. Flesh and faith.  
None with answers. All with purpose.

Strand’s breath continues, slow and steady.  
The beast inside her mind curls tighter around her cub.

She doesn’t wake.

**But she is heard.**
