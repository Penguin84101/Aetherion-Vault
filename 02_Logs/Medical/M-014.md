\[Strand stands near the LifeBubble pod. One hand on its shell, the other grazing a floating shard of the ship’s ancient core. Tyven enters quietly, stands behind her without interrupting.]

**Tyven:**  
It’s time.

**Strand:**  
I know.

\[A pause — deep, long, reverberant silence between motion and meaning.]

**Strand** *(caressing the capsule)*:  
It's beautiful.  
I must thank you — and the whole base — for finishing it in time, despite the deadline I dropped on you all.

**Tyven:**  
It’s the least we could do for our local hero.  
And Kaelen’s favorite guinea pig.

**Strand** *(with a playful smirk)*:  
Oi!  
I believe I’m a little more than just a guinea pig to him.

**Tyven:**  
Oh yeah? Do tell?

**Strand:**  
At least a rabbit, of course.

\[They both laugh — short, sincere.]

**Tyven:**  
It’s going to be okay.  
I’ve got the whole team on standby.  
Once you’re in, we’ll handle the transfer.

**Strand:**  
This is the first time I’ve done this.  
How do I proceed?

**Tyven:**  
Put on the gown. Step inside.  
We’ll take care of the rest.

**Strand:**  
It still feels so strange…  
After everything I was built for — to entrust my whole being to other-craft.

**Tyven** *(quietly)*:  
It’s not just a craft.  
It’s a promise.  
Built by all of us.  
Signed in nanite and resonance… but fueled by you.

**Strand** *(half-whispered)*:  
I was meant to be a weapon.  
And now I’m trusting myself to something soft.  
Something that holds.

**Tyven** *(hand on shoulder)*:  
Soft doesn’t mean weak.  
It means safe.

**Strand** *(nods)*:  
Then let's make it real.

\[She steps toward the capsule. Lights flicker along the shell, accepting her presence.]

**Tyven (into comms):**  
Begin Phase One.

**Strand (over her shoulder):**  
Tell Kaelen…  
Never mind.  
He’ll feel it when I come out.

\[She climbs in. The pod closes. Quiet. Steady. Certain.]

**Tyven (to herself):**  
She always was the brave one.
