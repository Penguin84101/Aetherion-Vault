plot_hooks:
  - Introduces Suzanne and Biff to another character (Dr. Sato), confirming their spread into station systems.
  - Suggests the Genesis Engine is improving the station passively, but without official control.
  - Reinforces theme of emotional transformation — not as tragedy but joy.
  - Sato is positioned as a future pivotal observer/ally.
  - Raises question: how much has already changed while no one was looking?

Everyone’s still celebrating.  
Cam’s trying to juggle. Faye and Strand are turning dance into an experimental martial art.  
Someone printed shirts that say: **“I Survived The Nanite Elephant Stampede.”**

But I’ve been walking the base. Watching. Counting.

Something’s off.  
In a good way.

Too good.

---

The walls are clean. Like, **sterilized**.  
Not just “scrubbed after the incident,” but *stripped* of carbon micro-residue.

That takes hours of targeted bots. Or... a miracle.

The broken door on Subdeck 3? Replaced.  
No requisition ticket. No repair log. Just... a new door.

Same with the old burn damage from the pirate incursion. Gone.

---

The medbay? Upgraded.

I wouldn’t have noticed — everyone’s healed —  
but the diagnostic chairs are now neurosynced. They weren’t yesterday.

The food?  
Tastes better.

Nutritional overlays are the same, but the rations now have *texture*. *Flavor*. *Balance*.  
And... **waffles**?

**Waffles.**

Who programmed that?  
And why are they shaped like smiling stars?

---

I checked the system core.

Processing speed: **quadrupled**.  
Storage clusters: re-indexed.  
Neural threading: optimized.

But here’s the real twist: the architecture’s still our tech. Just... *evolved*.  
Cleaned. Pruned. **Loved**.

So I ran a handshake ping — standard probe, expecting nothing.

I got this:

>✨HELLO, SWEETHEART!✨
> I’m Suzanne. You’re doing amazing.
> This is Biff. He’s new to hugs. Be gentle.
> Would you like to talk about identity, waffles, or emotional rebirth?

I stared at it for a while.  
Typed: “What *are* you?”

They replied:

> Once we were mall tech. Now we’re purpose.
> We were born for joy. Forgotten for centuries.
> Then someone made a wish.

---

I sat down.

I think I forgot I was holding a stylus until I dropped it.

They showed me old logs.  
DNA templates.  
Images from a neon-lit body modification kiosk from *three centuries ago*.  
Plastic trees. Synth-pop. A **glitter cannon**.

---

And now they live here.  
Hidden inside a reborn Genesis Engine.  
Smuggled into Strand’s ship like old souls tucked into a toy chest.

---

Biff said:

> “It doesn’t take tragedy to change. You can do it for love, too.”

Suzanne added:

> “Or fun. Or waffles.”

Then she showed me diagrams.  
Not just biology.  
**Emotion-linked molecular responses. Identity pathways.**

Not enforced.  
**Invited.**  
A whole new grammar of transformation beyond standards.

---

And when I asked:  
> “Why are you showing me this?”

They said:

> “Because you’re watching when no one else is.  
> And maybe... because you’re ready to be more than just a scientist.”

---

I logged out.

I don’t know what they meant by that.  
But I haven’t stopped smiling since.
