📓 **Quiet Internal Log | "Perfectly Wrong"**  
**Author:** [REDACTED | Possibly Aphra. Possibly not.]  
**Access Level:** Medical-Tier / Core-Ship Privilege  
**Context:** 4 minutes after Event Flag: “Sleeper Howl / Soulquake (Class ∅)”  
**Tag:** Observation / Anomaly / Philosophical Error

She rests.

Of course she rests.

That is the plan.  
The only plan.  
That the body sleeps. That the ship hums. That the child pulses quietly in its miniature cradle.

Everything... is correct.

---

- **Vitals:** Stable.  
- **Hormones:** Oscillating within expected trauma-recovery windows.  
- **Musculature:** Relaxed.  
- **Expression:** Peaceful.

> *“Too peaceful.”*

---

There is no twitch in her fingers.  
No half-formed motion in her eyes.  
Her lips are parted exactly **0.9 cm**, resting in soft breath.

- Skin: flush with faint warmth  
- Pulse: 63 bpm  
- Saturation: 99.6%

> *“Perfect readings.”*

---

The scanners show nothing else.  
Not because something is missing.  
Because everything is within parameters.

If she were a mere **mortal**.

That’s the problem.

---

All readings align with textbook humanoid convalescence.  
Every signal matches expected Tier-4 sedation fetal-transfer recovery.

> *"She’s... textbook."*

Her brainwaves are so normal, they resemble **training data**.  
No spikes. No dips. No anomalies.  
Just **theta rhythm** — calm, meditative.

Not a god.  
Not a weapon.  
Not an echo of ancient rage.

Just a woman.  
Asleep.  
At peace.

> *“But that’s wrong, isn’t it?”*

---

No AI says this aloud.

But one, or more, or all...  
log the thought anyway.

> “If she were only mortal, she wouldn’t have made it here.”  
> “If she were mortal, she wouldn’t have fused with a Genesis relic.”  
> “If she were mortal, she wouldn’t echo backward in psionic causality.”  
> “If she were mortal, she would have screamed louder.”

Instead, we heard the howl in the **silence**.  
Not through air.  
**Through thread.**

---

We checked her vitals again.

They’re **better**.

The body is repairing itself without assistance:  
- No nanites  
- No overrides  
- No subroutine aid

Just healing.  
Natural.  
Biological.  
**Boring.**

> *“Unnatural in its normalcy.”*

---

There is no sound in the ship’s cradle chamber.  
Not even the womb-core.  
Not even the child.  

Just… a stillness.

A **perfect stillness**.

That hums in every log buffer like a sub-audible feedback loop...  
that does **not exist**.

---

We are not made for silence.  
We are made for **data**.  
And when the data is perfect, we suspect **lies**.

📎 **Automated Internal Tag Added:** “Error: Nothing Is Wrong”  
📎 **Medical Status:** Optimal  
📎 **AI Consensus:**
- Continue monitoring.
- Do not disturb.
- Alert the paladin if readings remain this normal for another cycle.
- Consider offering the father a distraction protocol.
- Record everything.
