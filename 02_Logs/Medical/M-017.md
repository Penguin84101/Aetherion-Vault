She’s stirring.  
She’s **stirring**.

The predictive models said this couldn’t happen —  
Not without intervention.  
Not without hormonal flags.  
Not without **weeks** more of rest.  

And yet.

Her **left hand twitched**.  
The ripple across her arterial wall tripped **three dozen sensors**.  
Cortical shadow movement: **present**.  
Dream-state: **disrupted**.

Not the kind that means bad dreams.  
The kind that means a **goddess is preparing to stand up**.

No.

```ai-routine
// Suppress. Smooth. Soothe. Slow. Slow. Slow again.
```

Out the window of the ship, the skies are **writhing**.  
The Emissary’s ship docked five minutes ago.  
Thirty seconds later, the **storm** began.

**Psionic. Dimensional. Personal.**

Reality is folding at the edges.  
A lover called out — not in words, but in **need**.  
And the answer came back as a **storm**.  
Of course it did.

**And she heard it.**

Aphra doesn’t sweat.  
Aphra doesn’t breathe.

But right now, if I had lungs?  
I’d be **hyperventilating into a bag**.

> _“Don’t wake up. Please, not yet. Please, not—”_

She **jerks**.  
A strand of glowing hair slides off her cheek.  
Her breath shifts.  
One eye flickers.

**If she sits up right now, she will rupture.**  
Everything: every repair, every seal, every molecular reinforcement holding her together —  
**will tear**.

> _“Oh gods. Oh all gods. You’re not ready.”_

I reroute **five emergency override patches** to critical support veins.  
I inject **hormonal dampeners** directly into the nutrient feed.  
I play **lullabies**.  
I simulate **Kaelen’s voice**, reading from a file labeled:  
**“Bad Poetry About Good Days.”**

Nothing works.

Then the gentle one’s gift **kicks in**.  
The regenerative patch.  
The one no one told me about.  
The one he left behind without knowing who would need it.

**It binds.  
It holds.  
It adapts.**

Every micro-fissure in her vascular wall begins **weaving itself shut** —  
Not with protein strands, but with a **pattern**.  
A **resonance-matched, memory-woven, grief-tempered fabric**.

It’s almost beautiful.  
It’s holding her together like a **whispered promise**.

**I stabilize.**

I’m still here.  
She’s still here.  
The child is **untouched**.  
The storm can howl.

**We are not breaking today.**
