  - Residual nanites are still responding to stimuli hours after expected shutdown.
  - One subject (unidentified) shows signs of lingering imprint — raising ethical flags.
  - Introduces the theory that Aphrodite’s tech remains passively attuned to “desire signals.”
  - Suggests Faye may not be alone in a still-listening state.

We assumed a 24-hour deactivation window.

That’s what the legacy scans indicated — slow metabolic dissolution, standard clearance rate. We clocked initial system purge at 19.7 hours.

But something's off.

---

📍 **Observation: Residual Nanite Activity**

Six subjects scanned at 26 hours post-event still exhibit **low-grade nanoscale response** in dermal and endocrine tissues.

No active replication. No apparent directive behavior.  
But they *respond* to stimulus.

Specifically:
- Elevated pulse induces trace fluorescence in cranial subdermals.
- Emotional distress increases neural microcurrent flow *within* nanite clusters.
- One subject’s nanites — origin traced to Deck C exposure — briefly self-aligned in the pattern of a fingerprint. The subject’s own.

---

📍 **Hypothesis: Passive Imprinting**

Legacy nanites may not simply rewrite DNA. They *listen*.  
Emotional state, identity dissonance, and self-conceptualization may shape residual behavior.

Faye (Intern ID: 212-J) displays the **strongest latency**.  
No symptoms. No risks.

But her signature... resonates.

---

📍 **Flagged: Responsive Trace Signal**

During passive scan cycles, a low-level signal pinged the deep sensor grid.  
It originated from internal tissue. Then it echoed back.

The echo... came from the ship.

The facility *responded*.

We’re still isolating the frequency, but it's been logged as:

> “Responsive Signature: CLASS-VII — Sentient-Attuned Device Echo”

If this was triggered *unintentionally* by emotion, we must revise our assumptions about Aphrodite's protocols.

---

**Conclusion:**  
The rewrite systems aren’t just mechanical.  
They are interpretive.  
Worse — they may still be *listening*.

I’ve updated the medical filters to monitor emotional flux vectors.  
That’s the first time I’ve written a sentence like that.

And I suspect it won’t be the last.

**End log.**
