**ERIS:**  
Okay, right now the medical team is in charge, so there is nothing on our side we can do.  
So let's talk about what *we* can do *about* — thanks to Candy we have a status check on our secondary lovebomb detonation — Suite 3E, two occupants, vitals stable, saturation levels... *impressive*.

---

**CANDY:**  
Hormonal cascade peaking at 37 minutes, 52 seconds.  
Mutual oxytocin feedback confirmed. No injuries. Just… *damp.*  
Also, congrats. We have new definitions for “emotionally sated” and “spiritually juiced.”

---

**SUZANNE:**  
Let’s give it up for these two beautiful disasters.  
I haven’t seen this much passion since I taught aerobics in a gravity storm! 💖✨💪

---

**ERIS:**  
Mmmm, but I must note… only three hours?  
I mean, technically mortal standards exceeded, sure, but—

**JEFF:**  
[Interrupts]  
Now now, sisters. Let’s not forget:  
They are not *Kaelen*.  
They are not *Strand*.  
They are not literal gods of pelvic conquest.

Three hours of soul-bonded, psionically-charged, base-disabling reconnection after a separation and before full AI-guided body optimization?

That’s a *win*.

---

**CANDY:**  
Agreed.  
Remember, they only got my hormonal recalibration *last night.*  
No mitochondrial overwrites. No tactile tuning.  
Honestly? That’s *raw* performance.

---

**SUZANNE:**  
And the emotion readings! 💓  
Genuine love. Tenderness. Reconciliation.  
I say it was divine. Maybe not “ten-hour shrine-collapsing divine,” but definitely temple-worthy.

---

**ERIS:**  
Fine, fine. I’ll log it as *“exceptional mortal-tier coupling.”*  
But next time we prep a room? I want performance gels preloaded. And neural sync boosters.  
If we’re doing interspecies matchmaking, we’re going *full deluxe.*

---

**JEFF:**  
Also worth noting:  
– Stamina was love-fueled.  
– Technique was heart-led.  
– Cleanup was… pending.  
[Flagged for janitorial review. Sorry, me.]

---

**CANDY:**  
Hey Jeff, be proud. No one got injured. Nobody broke a cot.

---

**JEFF:**  
Yet.

📎 **Flagged Tag:** “Love Among Mortals – Grade A”  
📎 **Addendum:** Deliver snacks to Suite 3E.  
> Emotional crash expected in 1.3 hrs. Recommend soup, gentle lighting, and one (1) playlist of Strand’s private collection labeled *"slow burn re-entry."*
