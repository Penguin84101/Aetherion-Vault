📓 **Joint Medical & Botanical Log | “Let Her Sleep”**  
**Participants:**  
– Dr. Cela Tyven (Chief Medical Officer)  
– Fenn Oros (Chief Botanist & Bio-Flavorist)  
– Tars Veil (Blender of Concoctions / Culinary Chemist)  

**Location:** IX-3 Botanical Lab / Adjunct Pharmacology Kitchen  
**Timestamp:** T–31 Hours  
**Tone:** Focused. Affectionate. Slightly afraid of what Strand might do awake.  

---

**TYVEN (speaking first, direct):**  
“We’ll complete the transfer. That’s not in doubt.”  
“But when it’s done, Strand’s body will still be under peak strain.  
And she’ll wake up ready to fight the next god who walks through the door.”

**“We can’t let her.”**

---

**FENN (sifting through a wall of drying leaves, calmly):**  
“Then we use root-lull and psalm-ivy.  
They’re empathic stabilizers.  
Let the body sleep because it *knows* it is safe.  
Not because it’s forced to.”

---

**TARS (looking up from a beaker with an almost apologetic grin):**  
“I already started a base serum.  
Mixed half a drop of her DNA scan into the receptor-map.  
The blend will understand her instincts.  
It’ll ride the edge of them—then hug them into silence.”

**“No dreams. No waking. Just peace.”**

---

**TYVEN:**  
“She won’t like that.”

**FENN:**  
“We’re not asking her.”  
“We’re protecting her from the part of herself that doesn’t know how to survive peace.”

---

**TARS:**  
“I’ll even flavor it like her favorite midnight snack. She’ll never know.”

---

[The three pause. There’s no humor left now. Only determination.]

---

**TYVEN (softly, more to herself):**  
“She fought a war with her womb just to give this child a chance.  
Let her rest like a queen.  
Let her wake when the sun’s already out.”
