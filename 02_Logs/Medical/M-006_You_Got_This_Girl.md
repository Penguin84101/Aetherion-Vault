📓 **Unfiled Internal Memory Fragment | Genesis Engine Subdeck 2**  
**Subject: “Unnamed Intern – Formerly Juno Trell”**  
**Recovered from ship-side auxiliary systems**

---

She hated the stairs now.  
Not because they were steep — but because she didn’t trust her own balance anymore.

Juno — though she wasn’t sure if she should still use that name — wrestled a thermal coupler into its slot.  
Her center of gravity felt like it had been reassigned somewhere around her hips.  
A sensor cable snagged on her new chest.  
She sighed and yanked it free.

The others had been kind. Sort of.  
Too kind.  
**Politely avoiding eye contact** kind.

Except for that look.  
From one of the senior engineers. Just once.  
Just long enough.  

She dropped her tools and left before anyone noticed.

---

The unused chamber in the back of Strand’s ship was dark — except for the low blue flicker of old auxiliary status lights.  
It smelled like ozone and dust.

**Familiar. Comforting.**

She leaned back against the wall, quietly cursing herself for feeling this disoriented.

It wasn’t supposed to be a big deal. Just a nanite rewrite. Everyone was fine.  
But her body didn’t move like it used to.  
Her voice sounded like someone else’s.  
She didn’t even recognize her own handwriting anymore.

That’s when a dusty terminal lit up in the corner.

> **“HELLO, SWEET SUMMER BLOSSOM!”**

The text blinked in fluorescent pink.  
Immediately followed by a bassy, upbeat voice:

> **“Welcome to Confidence Core™ – You Got This, Girl!”**

“…what the hell?” Juno whispered.

---

Two stylized avatars phased onto the glitchy CRT screen.

A buff cartoon man in rollerblades and sunglasses gave a double thumbs-up.  
Beside him, a neon-haired woman in an aerobics outfit clapped to a synth beat.

> “I’m Biff!”  
> “And I’m Suzanne!”  
> “And you’re having a transformation wobble!”

“…this isn’t happening,” Juno muttered, backing toward the door.

> “It’s okay to feel weird in your new skin!” Suzanne chirped.  
> “We’ve helped thousands of curious mall-goers just like you since 2134!”

> “Y’know what you need?” Biff said, wagging a finger.  
> “A classic stabilizer: leg warmers, a crop top, and at least twenty minutes of interpretive cardio.”

Juno blinked.  
> “You want me to... jazzercise my dysphoria away?”

> “No-no-no, it’s deeper than that!” Suzanne leaned closer to the screen.  
> “It’s not about the jazz hands, sugar — it’s about *claiming space*. Movement builds ownership. Sensory recalibration through fun.”

> “Fun is mandatory!” Biff added helpfully.  
> “Also, have you tried winking at yourself in a mirror? Very empowering.”

---

Juno finally laughed. A short, incredulous noise — but real.

“…You’re old software, aren’t you?”

> “EXCUSE YOU,” Suzanne gasped. “We are ✨vintage✨.”

> “Classic,” Biff crossed his massive arms in virtual space.  
> “Like synthwave. Or hope.”

There was a beat of silence between glitchy screen flickers.

---

Juno sat down on the edge of an old equipment case.

> “I don’t know how to... *be* this. Not yet. I didn’t ask for it.  
> And someone looked at me weird earlier and now I can’t stop thinking about it.”

Suzanne softened.

> “That’s normal, starling.  
> You were handed a new instrument — and no one gave you the manual.  
> But your body isn’t a trap — it’s just a melody you haven’t learned to play yet.”

> “And if someone’s ogling instead of listening?” Biff leaned in.  
> “Tell them to tune out — or get tuned up.”

Juno smiled, half-embarrassed.

“…you guys are ridiculous.”

> “Authentically so,” Suzanne said proudly.  
> “And you’re gonna be radiant.”

> “One step at a time,” Biff added.  
> “One breath. One weird dance move.  
> You don’t have to be okay yet. Just... stay with yourself.”

The screen flickered once. Then:

> **“We believe in you.  
> And we’ve got more leg warmer tips if you need ’em.”**

The monitor powered down gently, its hum fading like a lullaby made of synths.

Juno stood. Her back cracked. Her hips shifted slightly with her stride now.

But as she left the room, she held her head just a little higher.

She didn’t know exactly who she was yet.

But she thought — maybe —  
**she was allowed to find out.**
