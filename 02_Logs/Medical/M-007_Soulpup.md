📓 **Medical Memo | Station IX-3 Anomaly Registry**  
**Subject:** Soulpup Containment Breach – Ethical or Adorable?

---

📍 **Entity Summary**

- **Specimen ID:** [Unregistered]  
- **Alias:** “Soulpup”  
- **Status:** Non-hostile / Highly Affectionate / Spatially Evasive  
- **Size:** Approximately 0.2 meters long (roughly puffle-sized), capable of expanding up to 0.7 meters on command or emotional prompt.  
- **Texture:** Soft, undefined fur / energy membrane / quantum fuzzball.   
- **Visual Effect:** Emits faint shimmer of blue-violet bioluminescence.  
- **Auditory Emissions:** Sub-audible purring; volume increases in the presence of affection, sugar, or ambient jazz.  
- **Emotional Response Index:** 11.3/10 (System Error)

📍 **Origin and Behavior**

Soulpup is suspected to be a **latent subexpression** of the Genesis Engine's core empathy matrix. Possibly an ambient byproduct of the “Wish Wave” during the Aetherion resonance surge.  

It appeared during routine atmosphere testing in Hydroponics.  
It has since been observed following technicians, curling into sleep pods, and cuddling anyone expressing visible sadness.

📍 **Containment Notes**

Containment has failed four times:

- Phased through medical quarantine barriers.  
- Evaded microfield lattices by “smiling.”  
- Nested briefly inside the laundry fabricator, resulting in ten sets of glitter pajamas.  
- Made direct telepathic contact with Lt. Halverson’s emotional trauma and **“hugged it out.”**  
- Then left. Politely.

📍 **Classification Status**

**Ethics Board Recommendation:** Still arguing.  
**Security Recommendation:** If it learns to multiply, panic.  
**Medical Recommendation:** Observation, hydration, and hugs.

📎 **Selected Crew Commentary**

**Dr. Sato (this log):**  
> “I refuse to classify it as a biohazard until it does something threatening. Or until it tries to marry the mop again.”

**Cmdr. Vehl:**  
> “It was last seen cuddling the CO2 scrubbers and making the engineers cry. Not in fear. In... joy. I’m authorizing provisional ‘morale entity’ status until further notice.”

**SOVEREIGN (AI):**  
> “If this creature achieves sapience, I recommend therapy and a podcast.”

**Strand:**  
> “It is made of light, longing, and lint. I approve.”

📍 **Addendum: Current Status**

Soulpup is now living inside the station's central greenhouse, sleeping on a heating coil wrapped in donated lab coats.

Crew morale is up 17%.  
So are heart rates.

Is it dangerous?

Possibly.

Is it healing something we didn’t know was broken?

...Almost definitely.
