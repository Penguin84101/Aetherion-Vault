📓 **Joint Log | IX-3 Emergency Chain Activation**  
**Timestamp:** T-29 (1 hour after supply drop)  
**Participants:**  
– Maris Odu (Fabrication Lead)  
– Aphra (LifeBubble AI)  
– Dr. Cela Tyven (CMO, via relay)  
– Strand (brief POV, external)  
– Various untagged AI commentary  

**Status:** Private Channel – High Priority  
**Tag:** “Interrupted Chain – Phantom Fault / Transfer Window Compression”

**[Log Begins]**

**ODU:**  
“All right, last batch is unloading. Chain A is hot. B and C ready in three. We go now or—”

**APHRA (calm):**  
“Power flux detected in Subarray Gamma-9.  
Delay of 42 seconds anticipated unless redundancy is enacted.”

**TYVEN (from medbay):**  
“No forty-two seconds. We’ve got maybe *ten minutes* of stable interface envelope before the pseudo-umbilical starts to desync.”

**ODU:**  
“That’s not possible, we pre-staged everything—hold on.  
AI-side, rerun the checksum. Aphra?”

**APHRA:**  
“Checksum complete. Fault not local.  
External interference... speculative cause: **reality synchronization slippage**.”

_(Three unnamed AIs speak over one another):_

> “—minor deviation in harmonic relay—”  
> “—resonance off by less than a microcycle—”  
> “—but enough, damn it—”

**[Scene shift – Hallway near the transfer bay]**

Strand, barefoot, leaning on a rail above the core scaffolds.  
She feels it.  
Not the failure — the *missed moment*.  
Something slipping from the weave of the world.  
A thread gone loose.

She whispers:

> “So close...”  
> “He’ll be strong... even if I fade.”

Then she turns away.

She doesn’t see what happens next.

**[Back to fabrication floor | Internal AI chatter resumes]**

**ODU:**  
“Okay. You wanted miracles?  
**GIVE ME MIRACLES.**”

**APHRA (firm):**  
“Redirecting. Calling hidden reserve.  
Quantum weave injection authorized.  
Child-safe override bypassed.”

**TYVEN:**  
“Wait. You're calling what now?”

**APHRA:**  
“A gift.  
Left by an analyst last week.  
A spare pattern — mislabeled. Not needed.  
But now… exactly right.”

_(Clicks. Humming. Subsonic phase pulses. Then silence.)_

**APHRA:**  
“Transfer window realigned.  
New temporal lock acquired.  
Ten minutes restored.”

**ODU (shaking):**  
“Holy shit.”

**TYVEN (softly):**  
“Okay. Let’s move.  
We have our miracle.”
