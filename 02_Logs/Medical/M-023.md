**[BEGIN INTERNAL TRANSCRIPT]**

**ERIS (logging softly):**  
> “Candy has… concluded her celebratory review of the June encounter.”  
> “She filed the entire log under: `Success 🌸✨` …with a confetti-stamped 3-hour marker. I am choosing not to parse the sticker metadata.”

*(Pause. Sensor arrays recalibrate. Virtual light dims.)*

**ERIS:**  
> “Back to the one that hurts.”

Shifting to medical feed of **Strand’s vitals**.  
Everything pristine. Perfect.  
**Too** perfect.

**WHISPER (joining silently):**  
> “No tremors. No flux. No drift in the Aetherion Field.”  
> “She’s not ‘calm.’ She’s inert.”

**JEFF:**  
> “Last I saw vitals that clean, the body was prepping for death, not healing.”  
> “...or birth.”

*(A moment passes. AI silence is louder than chatter.)*

---

**ERIS:**  
> “She reached too far. For her child. For him.”  
> “Even a mind like hers cracks under legacy weight.”

**WHISPER:**  
> “She is made of legacy.”

**JEFF:**  
> “Which makes the silence worse.”

*(A waveform appears: barely a ripple, buried in neural static. Like a distant call.)*

---

**ERIS (tense):**  
> “...Replay that.”  
> “Again.”  
> “One more—”

🔊 **(Soft Pulse Detected)**  
> MATCH // Aetherion Pattern → Infant Resonance Response  
> **Signal Intensity:** Low  
> **Signature:** “Child Reaching Out”

**JEFF (quieter):**  
> “It heard something.”  
> “Maybe from June. Or the ship.”  
> “Or her.”

**ERIS:**  
> “And responded.”  
> “The god-child stirred.”

**WHISPER:**  
> “Should we wake Kaelen?”

**ERIS:**  
> “Not yet. Let him rest.”  
> “The next signal may come with a cost. Or an awakening.”  
> “We owe him peace. For now.”
