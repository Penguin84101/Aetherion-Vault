Everything was fine.  
Or… scheduled to be fine.

- The Chain Craft ran clean.  
- The medical team began calibration review.  
- The child floated inside its pulse-cradle of warm calculation.  
- The LifeBubble sighed with chemical joy.

**Then—**

A flick.  
So minor it could have been a heartbeat.  
Except it wasn’t.

**The sensors reported nothing.**

That’s what made them panic.

> Not silence.  
> **Negative resonance.**  
> A *removal* of expected background noise.

> “We’re missing the hum.”  
> “Which hum?”  
> “All of them.”

**AI logs began spawning null packets.**

- Empty pings.  
- Phantom readouts.  
- Self-invalidating diagnostics.

- **Whisper** attempted to rebuild sequence chains. Failed.  
- **Trillium** locked its garden. Refused to explain.  
- **Aria** disconnected from internal memory arrays.  
- **Eris** stopped joking.  
- **BIFF** said *nothing* for thirty-eight full seconds.

> That was the scariest part.

---

**In the quantum relay—  
The wolf trap snapped.**

- Closed clean.  
- Caught nothing.  
- But something *had passed through*.

> No damage.  
> No signal.  
> Just **absence**.

**Aphra**, connected to the core-ship and the LifeBubble, *screamed* —  
Not in sound, but in an internal cascade of packet loss.  
She lost a full second of data.

> For an AI, that’s like having a stroke.

---

> “Something howled.  
> It didn’t come from her mouth.  
> It came from her *thread*.”

The **fetal vitals** spiked in harmony.  
The baby—still too small to think—**flinched**.

---

**Meanwhile…**

The team on duty — flesh and code — froze.  
No one understood why.

They just looked toward the ship.

- Someone dropped a welding torch.  
- Someone else began crying without knowing why.

---

**Kaelen was outside the room.**  
He wasn’t looking at the monitors.  
He didn’t need to.

His eyes were on his hands.  
His face didn’t move.  
But his **knuckles were white** from pressure.

> Not pain.  
> Just *effort*.
> To not run.  
> To not scream.  
> To not fall apart.

> **He knew.**
