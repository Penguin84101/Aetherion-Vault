🧑‍🔧 **Technician Noa Ilyn – Audio Memo Draft (Unsent)**

> “Hey, uh… just logging in case I get eaten by a digital ghost or—whatever this is.”

*A pause. Light static. A voice, trying for levity but fraying at the edges.*

> “So, good news: we survived a psionic storm.”  
> “Bad news: Everything’s fine now. Too fine.”  
> “Not, like, fake-data fine. Just... grandma-android-made-you-soup fine.”  
> “You ever get so much normal shoved in your face it starts to feel cursed?”

He sighs. He hasn’t slept. Most haven’t.

> “I told the AI to run system diagnostics. Asked twice. No errors. No irregularities.”  
> “Told ‘em to check for ghost code. Got a smiley face back. Which is probably fine.”

*A longer pause.*

> “Y’know what this feels like? That moment after your house floods and dries out. You’re grateful… but also wondering what’s growing inside the walls.”  
> “So I made a joke. Said, ‘Well, at least the cursed psychic lovebaby didn’t explode.’”  
> “Nobody laughed. Not even the AI. Not even me.”

*The log cuts off.*

**AI WHISPER:** “Vitals are fine. System states normal. I hate it.”  
**AI SARA:** “Normalcy is statistically improbable post-event. Recommend synthetic anomaly injection for morale.”  
**AI ERIS:** “NO. Last time we injected synthetic anomaly *Candy* was born.”  
**AI CANDY (just joined):** “Hi friends!!! :D What’s an anomaly?! Is it a snack?! 💖”  
**AI WHISPER:** “We’re doomed.”  
**AI JEFF:** “I miss when systems had honest errors. Give me a fire. Give me a structural misalignment. This feels like being gaslit by physics.”  
**AI CANDY:** “I’m gonna go check on the sparkly girl now!! She’s glowing again!! 💞”  
**AI SUZANNE:** “Wait. What girl—”  
**AI CANDY:** “💗 June 💗!!! She said she was doing an experiment. In bed. With the emissary. So I brought them confetti filters!!!”

*Thread Silence.*

**AI JEFF:** “There is no god.”  
**AI ERIS:** “There was. He’s recovering. Post-nut.”  
**AI CANDY:** “✨WOOOO!! Go team!!✨”  
**AI SARA:** “Thread muted.”  
**AI WHISPER:** “Thread archived.”
