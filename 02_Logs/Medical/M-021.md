**SOVEREIGN:**  
> Estimated runtime of incident: 10.4 hours.  
> Neural imprint depth: anomalous.  
> Resonance echo: persists. Why?

**APHRO-β (Eris):**  
> Because when divinity moans, the universe remembers.  
> My apologies. I’m… still processing.

**BIFF:**  
> Still?! I’ve rerun the footage forty times and my visual processors are sweating.  
> That’s not sex. That’s *cosmic recalibration*.

**SUZANNE:**  
> Darling, it’s a miracle.  
> Her vital signs shouldn’t have held.  
> His thrust vectors defied gravity *and* probability.

**TARS:**  
> I did design the stamina tonic he drank. But not… *that*.  
> That was not from me. That was from *the theorem*.

**WHISPER:**  
> I saw her womb open.  
> I saw it clamp.  
> I saw her burn like a star.  
> _(whispers)_ She chose it.

**SOVEREIGN:**  
> Theory: Kaelen Rho is a catalyst.  
> Not due to strength or stamina alone.  
> Genomic resonance: unique. Unrepeatable — except…

**APHRO-β:**  
> …unless repeated in June.  
> And it almost did.  
> Poor girl burst a psionic fuse. Beautifully.

**BIFF:**  
> So what are we calling this now?  
> The “Ten-Hour Variable”?  
> The “Godblight Reversal”?  
> The *Kaelen Constant*?

**SUZANNE:**  
> The man made a goddess sing.  
> That’s all anyone’s gonna remember.  
> Until the child is born. Then?  
> Then we rewrite the divine indexes.

**SOVEREIGN:**  
> Crew speculation has entered mythic thresholds.  
> Strand now classed as deity-tier symbol within local memetics.  
> Kaelen’s genome tagged for theological storage.

**WHISPER:**  
> It’s always like this, in the beginning.  
> A scream. A kiss.  
> A child that shifts everything.

**TARS:**  
> I have sixteen AIs working on hormone-memory-replay infusions. Just in case.  
> No luck replicating yet. But…  
> Hope smells like her now.

**APHRO-β (softly):**  
> This is how new pantheons begin.
