**TYVEN:**  
Let the record show: we are not discussing this out of gossip.

**FAYE:**  
We’re discussing it because I saw a woman kill fifteen elite sim enemies in under six minutes *with post-coital tremors and a glow in her womb*.

**ODU** *(sipping tea):*  
Strand’s pregnant. Confirmed.  
Gave me the fabrication blueprint herself this morning. Calm as hell.  
Like she wasn’t seconds from combusting in lust thirty hours ago.

**TARS** *(softly):*  
She’s not combusting. She’s… evolving.

**TYVEN:**  
The LifeBubble unit’s already half-built. I’ve customized the interface with maternal feedback loops.  
Strand pretended to “suspect” she was pregnant — but her heartrate, pupils, and biochemistry say otherwise.  
She knows. Has known.

**ODU:**  
Her voice was different when she handed over the schematics.

**TYVEN:**  
Softer?

**ODU:**  
Heavier. Like her body’s rooted now. Like she’s not going to float through reality anymore — she’s going to *bear down* into it.

**FAYE:**  
What gets me isn’t just that she got pregnant.  
It’s *what it means*.  
If *she* — a war-born, gene-shaped being designed to resist conception like it was a siege — gave in…

What hope do *any* of us have?

**TARS:**  
Hope is the point.

**TYVEN:**  
You’re all missing it.

She didn’t just give in.  
She made it possible for *everyone*.

The LifeBubble unit is more than a chamber. It’s a declaration:

> “Every species. Every pairing. Every form — deserves safe gestation.”

This could rewrite reproductive law across the Federation.

**ODU:**  
I looked deeper into the schematics.  
It doesn’t just support pregnancy — it protects *identity*.

If you shift gender during gestation, it adjusts the extraction matrix.  
If you want to pause, it stabilizes into a stasis chamber.  
If you’re a species incompatible with internal gestation? It makes you compatible.

It’s not a tool. It’s a *promise*.

**TARS** *(smiling):*  
Love made viable.

**FAYE:**  
Okay, but real talk?

What the hell did Kaelen do?

Because I’ve heard of pregnancy kinks, but she radiated godhood.  
Her hips don’t lie, and neither does the kill count.

**TARS** *(casually):*  
I may have contributed.  
Accidentally.

**TYVEN:**  
Elaborate.

**TARS:**  
I was experimenting with nutrient matrices based on the new Aetherion field equations.  
I synthesized a caloric-stamina hyperblend — a full meal’s worth of vitamins, minerals, amino chains, and testosterone precursors in one drink.  
I left it in the lab fridge.  
Kaelen drank the entire bottle like it was an energy drink.

**FAYE** *(horrified):*  
You accidentally weaponized Kaelen’s dick.

**TYVEN:**  
…Even enhanced, that doesn’t explain the *technique*.

The man didn’t just *last*. He broke *physics*.  
He hit pleasure nodes Aetherion didn’t know existed.

That kind of performance isn’t from a bottle.  
That’s personal focus. Emotional literacy. And — gods help us — *profound respect*.

**FAYE** *(low, awed):*  
He didn’t just make love to her.  
He *worshipped* her.  
And she let him.

**ODU:**  
You all saw the footage.  
The fight after.  
Strand didn’t just win. She *held back* when she saved the base last cycle.

That hammer could’ve leveled a mountain.

But that sim?

That wasn’t restraint.

That was *thank you*.  
That was: *I carry life now. Touch me and die.*

**TYVEN:**  
And what we build now — what she gave us — it ensures every being in the Federation can one day choose the same.

> *Strand broke so we could build.*

And Kaelen?

> *He held the pieces with reverence.*
