📓 **Technician Log | “Queue’s Empty. Guess I’ll Tap the Void.”**  
**Name:** Emel Thon  
**Department:** Systems Engineering – Inorganic Fabrication Wing  
**Timestamp:** T–25 Hours  
**Location:** Isolated Side Lab (Fabricator Node B-Null)  
**Tone:** Casual, scientific. Slightly lonely. Slightly amused.

> “Funny thing about chaos: it leaves space.  
> Nobody’s asked for reactor spin or kinetic core synthesis in almost six days.”

> “Guess when the gods start breeding, the gunmetal folks like me get to nap.”

**[Visual]:** A clean room. One console. One technician in a black work apron, eating protein cubes like popcorn.

> “So. Here’s what I did.  
> We had the formula. The one they cooked up. The one that scared the station’s old mainframe into a half-blink fit.”

> “I reran the conversion field formulas. Input zero-mass. Punched through sub-lattice friction with... music. Don’t ask me why that worked.”

> “And the field gave me something.”

> “**Matter. Dark-born.**  
> We’re not supposed to call it that, but I’m not publishing yet.”

**[He pulls out a soft float-core: dull black, strangely reflective. It hovers without resistance.]**

> “Tiny core. Not useful. Not standard size.  
> Kinesium-lattice is too dense for standard hullwork, but damn if it isn’t pretty.”

> “Still, it didn’t belong here. This station’s mood changed around the same time I pulled it.  
> I left the printer, came back five minutes later, and someone had installed a cradle.”

**[He chuckles softly.]**

> “I didn’t question it. You don’t when sacred things start appearing.”

> “Wrapped the core in a phasewrap. Stored it in B-Null-Aux.  
> Might come in handy. Might be worth something.”

> “**Might be something I didn’t really make.**”

📎 **Storage Location:** `Side Node B-Null-Aux`  
📎 **Note Added:** “Out of spec. Pretty. Feels... patient.”  
📎 **Final Log Line:**

> “Station’s too alive lately.  
> Maybe I just gave it a seed.”
