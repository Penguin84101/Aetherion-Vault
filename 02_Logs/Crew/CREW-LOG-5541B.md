**CAM** *(watching feed idly):*  
So, uh… Strand’s walking the upper deck again.

**FAYE** *(chewing gum):*  
Probably stretching. She earned it.  
Ten hours of interdimensional… uh, cardio.

**GORO:**  
Was it ten exactly?

**FAYE** *(smirking):*  
Ten hours and twenty-two minutes. I timed it. Purely for scientific purposes.

**TYVEN:**  
You recorded ten hours, filled the gaps using— Oh my gods—

**STRAND (on feed, mid-walk):**  
[Stops mid-step]  
[Shudders, subtly]  
[Legs quiver slightly]  
[Pauses — too long — then resumes walking... poorly]

**CAM:**  
Uh.

**FAYE** *(leaning in):*  
Did she just—

**TYVEN:**  
Her knees buckled.

**GORO** *(seriously):*  
That’s the same micro-shiver pattern as a neural-spike pleasure flashback.  
We see it in trauma patients. Or people with *really* good memories.

**CAM** *(horrified):*  
I think she heard us.

**FAYE:**  
Through a camera?

**TYVEN:**  
That shouldn’t be possible—

**FAYE:**  
"Shouldn’t"? Or in a *Kaelen-fucked-me-into-a-new-physics-engine* kind of way?

**[Strand stops again. Turns. Tilts head. Eyes narrow… and look directly at the security feed.]**

**STRAND (on camera, lips not moving):**  
“I can hear you.”

**ALL:**  
[Absolute, synchronized silence]

**TYVEN (whispering):**  
What the hell—

**CAM:**  
She talked through the camera?

**FAYE** *(delighted):*  
Nope. She didn’t *speak*.  
She transmitted *intent*.  
Vibrated the camera’s audio pickup using *will alone*.

**GORO:**  
That’s Genesis-AI level reflexive tuning.  
That’s... not normal.

**TYVEN:**  
Do you realize what this means?

**CAM:**  
It means we can’t talk about *the Event* near any connected device.

**FAYE** *(still grinning):*  
It also means Kaelen Rho is officially too powerful for basic gossip.

**TYVEN:**  
He rewired her neurobiological signal output using nothing but sex and sarcasm.

**GORO** *(nodding solemnly):*  
She’s syncing with the ship again. Through him.

**[Strand walks off-screen — but her hips still quiver with every step.]**

**[Final frame: a smirk. Dangerous. Gleaming.]**

**FAYE:**  
I’ll say this once, and never again:  
That man broke the ship,  
broke the legend,  
and apparently turned her into a psionic eavesdropper with just—

**TYVEN (cutting in):**  
Enough.
