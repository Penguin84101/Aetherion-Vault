**[BEGIN LOG]**

**VROSS** *(arms folded)*:  
This is a Class-Ω combat sim. No organic personnel should survive past Phase Three without support.

**TYVEN**:  
She made it to Phase Six.  
Unarmored.  
On foot.  
After what was—let’s just say—a long night.

**FAYE** *(quietly)*:  
This is post-Rho Event, isn’t it?

**ODU**:  
The files are timestamped. It’s hours after. Not even a full rest cycle. She’s… glistening.

**GORO** *(softly)*:  
She walked in barefoot.  
That’s a statement.

---

*[Footage plays. STRAND enters the sim room. Calm. Glowing. Stretching one leg like she’s testing for tremors.]*

---

**FAYE** *(wide-eyed)*:  
She’s limping like it’s delicious.

**TYVEN** *(blushing)*:  
That’s residual pelvic trauma.  
I… read the readouts.

**VROSS**:  
She doesn’t even blink. Watch that wrist grab—she disarms a plasma knight and crushes its head without breaking stride.

**ODU**:  
That’s not technique. That’s possession.

---

*[STRAND dodges, spins, flips a drone, breaks its chassis with one elbow.]*

---

**FAYE**:  
What the hell did he do to her?

**GORO** *(flatly)*:  
He rearranged her chi.

---

*[They watch as she howls — a sound that echoes in the sim chamber, **warping the sound dampeners**.]*

---

**VROSS** *(tilting head)*:  
She just screamed and the **environment AI flinched**. That’s not a normal variable.

**TYVEN** *(reading overlay)*:  
The Engine tagged the output as “**Divine**.”  
I didn’t even know that was a valid metric.

---

*[The footage ends. STRAND kneels in the center, gasping, a hand over her navel. Sweat. Blood. Beauty. Chaos.]*

---

**FAYE** *(softly)*:  
So… she’s definitely pregnant, right?

**TYVEN**:  
Heartbeat confirmed.

**ODU** *(numb)*:  
With what?  
A god? A weapon? A myth?

**VROSS** *(very quietly)*:  
With **consequence**.

**TYVEN**:  
We should probably update the chain of command.

**FAYE** *(grinning)*:  
And say what?  
“Commander, sorry to report, Strand got **bred into sainthood** by the theoretical physicist and now she’s rewriting the martial arts manual using lust”?

**GORO** *(nodding)*:  
That’ll do.
