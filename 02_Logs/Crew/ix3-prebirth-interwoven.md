## 📘 1.LOG: “Wires Breathe Differently at Night”  
**Log Source:** Technician Merrin Dosk  
**Timestamp:** T–46h  
**Location:** LifeBubble Subshell Assembly Node

> "NOTES, 04:17h, still awake.  
> Thought this would be a standard reverse-polymer frame job.  
> Instead I’m hand-braiding fetal isolation coils that *scream* if I twist them wrong."

> "Two hours ago, Tareen told me the coolant gel ‘shimmered in song’ and I told her to drink water.  
> Half an hour ago, I looked into the stabilization resin chamber and saw my mother’s face.  
> She's been dead for seven years."

> "Either I’m sleep-deprived, or the base is talking back.  
> Either way... I’m getting good at this."

> *If it works, don’t fix it.*

## 📘 2.LOG: “We All Started Whispering at the Same Time”  
**Log Source:** Technician Tareen Hux (Spanner Unit, Crafting Chain Subgroup 2)  
**Timestamp:** T–41h  
**Location:** Midframe Staging

> "I swear I only meant to weld the bracket.  
> But I… reached for the torch, and it was already burning."

> "The metal folded itself before I touched it. Just a little.  
> Like it knew what shape I meant."

> "No one’s saying it out loud, but we’re all moving faster than we should.  
> Parts are slotting where no blueprint exists."

> "Joss started humming a song she didn’t know, and the comms picked it up as a schematic."

> "It’s like the theorem’s in the air.  
> Like... the base wants the baby born safe."

> *“We’re not engineers anymore.  
> We’re midwives.”*

## 📘 3.LOG: “The Backup for the Backup”  
**Log Source:** Dr. Cela Tyven (Chief Medical Officer)  
**Timestamp:** T–37h  
**Location:** MedBay / Observation Deck Over LifeBubble Chamber

> *"What do I do if it fails?"*  
> *"What happens if we can’t transfer in time?"*

I know we’re past viable thresholds for surgical alternatives.  
I know her vitals are holding.  
But I also know this place runs on miracle math and suppressed fear.

**Aphra hovers**.  
(Not literally — she pulses across the light tiles near the fetal interface.)  
She’s the LifeBubble’s personality core. Mostly calm. Usually wise. Occasionally terrifying.

> “You are worried,” she says.  
> “So I am allowed to be.”

I ask if she has a backup.

> “I do,” she answers.  
> “But it is cruel.”  
> “She would live. But forget. He would remain. But ache.”

And I can’t let that happen.

> *“Don’t use it,”* I told her.  
> *“Let her remember. Let him ache. Let the child be born of truth. Not convenience.”*

📎 Emotional Saturation Threshold: High  
📎 Risk Level: Acceptable (barely)
