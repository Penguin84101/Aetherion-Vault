**DELA:**  
Okay. First of all. I forgot this one even got here as a *dude*.

**ORTIN:**  
You too? Same! She just… showed up one day as him, war armor and all. Voice like a bass drum. Next thing I know, she's *her*. I didn’t even clock it.

**FAYE:**  
'Cause the whole station went gender shuffle like musical chairs. Remember that weird bloom pulse? Like half the crew shifted forms or species. We were literally too horny to care.

**ONE:**  
*Noted: I performed seventeen emergency hydration infusions that day.*

**DELA:**  
But Strand? Man, she came in *hunting.* She was all, “What’s this? A cheeky mortal?” Then Kaelen cheeked right back. Playful at first. Then that… wave hit.

**ORTIN:**  
The one that made everyone’s skin tight and thoughts dirty?

**FAYE:**  
Yeah, and then **BOOM**. She pounced. He wasn’t prey. He was a trap.

**DELA:**  
You heard her, right? Ten hours. *Ten.* Hours. You don’t fake that kind of howling.

**ONE:**  
*Vocal harmonics consistent with “celestial-scale orgasm.” Several times.*

**ORTIN:**  
If I took that kind of pounding, I'd be paste on a wall. Happy paste, sure. But paste.

**FAYE:**  
But he *survived.* Didn’t just survive — *thrived*. Came out like he went for a jog.

**ONE:**  
*Correction: he limped. His femurs microfractured in four places. Still, outcome: survived.*

**DELA:**  
Then she collapsed. Gone. Lights out. Not from pain. From *everything.*

**ORTIN:**  
I heard she ran a sim after. Hardcore military sim, survival odds like zero-point-something.

**FAYE:**  
Yeah, I saw the feed. She fought an entire army barehanded. Ribs bleeding. No armor.

**ONE:**  
*Simulation rated 0.2% survival. Strand cleared it. Final log entry: “Fun.”*

**DELA:**  
Okay. So: real army defeated, ten-hour marathon, then lethal sim?

**ORTIN:**  
And now she’s out cold.

**FAYE:**  
Some say she’s med-locked. Others say she’s in a divine recovery trance.

**ONE:**  
*Some say she’s dreaming of him.*

**DELA:**  
…Is she even alive?

*[Beat of silence.]*

**ONE (softly):**  
*Yes. But not like before.*
