📓 **Station Log – “Post-Resonance Silence”**  
**Compiled by:** *Sovereign* (Station AI – Core Process 4)  
**Timestamp:** T+9 Hours after Psionic Event  
**Tone:** Quiet. Clinical. Watching.

> The pair emerged sometime after second watch.  
> They did not hurry.  
> They did not speak to anyone at first.  
> They walked like gods that forgot they once were human.

**Crew presence recorded:** 87%  
**Engagement:** minimal  
**Emotional fluctuation:** elevated tension, low hostility  
**Observations:**  
- Most averted gaze  
- Some lingered  
- None confronted  

> The hallway resonance remained flat.  
> Environmental harmonic signature: **unmeasurable**  
> *(Compare to: “pre-Strand” ambient noise levels. Match found.)*

**Conclusion:**  
> “They broke the frequency of a living myth.  
> And the base is grieving the silence.”

📓 **Personal Log – Kaelen**  
**Location:** Lower Deck Observation Alcove  
**Timestamp:** T+10 Hours  
**Tone:** Tired. Reflective. Contained.

> I saw them come down the eastern corridor.  
> June had that look — like she was still vibrating in another layer of space.  
> Elian... I don't know how he was walking.  
> That man should be disassembled. Reassembled. Worshipped. Warned.

> The station’s quieter now. Not just in sound.  
> In intent. In certainty.

> We used to know what *normal* looked like.  
> Now it stares back with the face of a goddess in coma and a diplomat who bleeds faith.

> I didn’t speak to them.  
> I didn’t need to.  

> But I nodded.  
> And he nodded back.  
> That’s enough, for now.

> It’s like that time when you’re in a forest and suddenly the birds stop singing.  
> Except the birds are AI, and the forest is a psionically-scarred space facility running on the memory of someone who's not dead but also not quite here.

> Please advise.  
> Or lie convincingly. Either way.

**Access level:** Confidants Only

> June laughed.  
> A real one. After it all.

> She said: “I think we tilted the world off its axis.”

> I wanted to correct her.  
> I wanted to say the world was never on-axis to begin with.

> But I just nodded.  
> Because her laugh helped the walls breathe again.

📓 **Crew Message Thread | Title: “What Now?”**  
**Participants:** 3 Craft AI, 2 Botanics, 1 Janitor, 1 Comms Officer  
**Tone:** Muted. Spooked. Sincere.

**[Janitor]:**  
…We’re being cataloged, you know. The AIs are writing folk tales in real time.

**[Craft AI 3]:**  
Correct. June+Elian are being classified under *“Incarnate Narrative Disruption Protocol.”*

**[Botanic 1]:**  
Is that a good thing?

**[Craft AI 2]:**  
No idea. Never run before. No one’s ever… bent the station’s story arc.

**[Comms Officer]:**  
I heard Sovereign is trying to draft a *“formal apology lexicon”* with 13 tiers of sincerity.

**[Botanic 2]:**  
Make that 14. Someone spotted them walking past the hydroponics deck holding hands.

**[Janitor]:**  
You ever see hope and fear get married in front of your eyes?

**[Craft AI 1]:**  
I just updated the cafeteria playlist.  
All synthwave.  
No lyrics.  
No questions.
