---

**VEY:**  
So.
Quiet night.

**FAYE (blinking slowly):**  
Liar.

**ODU (not looking up):**  
Nope. No. Don’t. We're not doing this.

**FAYE:**  
You mean the part where the not-soundproof alien warship hosted a full ten-hour broadcast of high-performance bed creaking and—

**TYVEN:**  
Faye, I will sedate you.

**CAM (shell-shocked):**  
There was whimpering.  
Tri-lingual whimpering.

**FAYE (innocently):**  
That last part in Aetherion dialect? That was a marriage rite.

**ODU (sputtering):**  
Are you fluent now?!

**FAYE:**  
I have ears. And a translation AI. Also trauma.

**VEY (deadpan):**  
Just noting that while I was dead, the station was *quiet*.
And now I’m back, and people are performing the miracle of conception through hull insulation.

**TYVEN:**  
We scanned the ship’s external plates this morning.  
They’re humming.  
Not the engine — the walls.  
Like it climaxed in sympathetic vibration.

**FAYE:**  
More like laughing in maniac triumph, actually.

**CAM (very quietly):**  
He made a god beg.  
We all heard it.

**FAYE (nodding):**  
We did.

**ODU (face in hands):**  
The quiet ones are always dangerous.

**TYVEN:**  
Kaelen stopped by medbay earlier. Asked about acoustic containment protocols.  
He looked... sweaty.

**FAYE (grinning):**  
Did he limp?

**TYVEN (after a pause):**  
Yes.  
And smiled while doing it.

**CAM:**  
I’m never going into that ship again.  
There are sounds I’ll never unhear.

**ODU:**  
The Genesis Engine tried to offer me a playlist labeled “Strand Moaning – Live Suite.”  
I deleted it.

**FAYE:**  
You didn’t delete it.

**ODU:**  
*I renamed it.*

**VEY:**  
So are we filing a report or…

**TYVEN (firmly):**  
Absolutely not.  
Medical discretion.  
Fabrication silence.  
AI noncompliance.

**FAYE:**  
So we’re all agreeing to pretend it was a resonance flare.

**CAM:**  
I’m pretending I’ve never had ears.

**VEY:**  
Still. For the record...  
Ten hours.

**FAYE (quietly, reverent):**  
God help the second round.
