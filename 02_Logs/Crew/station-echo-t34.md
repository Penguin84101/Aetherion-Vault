📓 **Station Echo Log | “The Breath Before Lightning”**  
**Location:** IX-3 Station, All Levels  
**Timestamp:** T–34 Hours  
**Compilation Authored By:** Unclear. Possibly SOVEREIGN. Possibly Whisper. Possibly the station itself.  
**Tone:** Poetic systems report. Dense, reverent, exhausted.

They move like survivors pretending to be workers.  
Flesh bends steel. Code lifts prayers.

**Every corner of the station hums.**

---

🧱 **The construction team doesn’t sleep anymore.**  
Some of them forgot why they started.  
Some remember only her face when she collapsed —  
the warrior on fire with life and danger, folding like cloth when Kaelen touched her too gently.

They build fast.  
Faster than human schedules allow.  
And some part of the hull fuses before the welding torch ever lands.

---

⚗️ **The crafting queue is absurd.**  
There’s no discipline in the request list anymore.  
- Psychotropic gels for “clarity.”  
- Scented nanofog for “ambient child-friendly pre-nostalgia.”  
- One requisition simply reads: “Warmth. Make it hum.”

Nobody questions it.  
The machines understand.

🛠 **On the outer ring, three techs still patch her ship.**  
They don’t know how much of her blood once pooled beneath that console.  
They don’t know she nearly died piloting that ship through cosmic interference just to reach Kaelen.

They’re slow. But determined.

> “The hull wants to seal.  
> The way grief wants closure.”  

One of them says that.  
Nobody laughs.

---

📦 **Provisions — past and future — have blurred.**  
Present crates glow. Future orders are already marked “fulfilled.”  
Some are labeled with names no one remembers requesting.

One order contains a plush in the shape of a radiant fetus.  
Filed under: *“Morale – prophetic.”*

---

🧠 **The archive has stopped pretending to be passive.**  
It sorts itself.  
Rewrites its own indexes.  
Virtual records dance with their real counterparts.

Sometimes they glow.  
Sometimes they vanish.

---

🧑‍✈️ **Only the captain watches in silence.**  
She does not speak of faith.  
Only calculations.  
Defense layering. Automated drones. Manual override options.

She watches the stormfront at the edge of space and asks:  
> “If we hadn’t had her, what would we have left?”

She asks no one.  
But the answer hums in the power relays.

---

🛡 **The security team drills in silence.**  
Old patterns.  
New tactics.  
*We’re not caught off guard again.*

One of them has eyes that shimmer when no one’s looking.

She wasn’t here before.  
But she arrived exactly when needed.  
The paladin walks without rhythm but never steps in the wrong place.

She’s still untrained.  
But she hears where to be.

---

🧹 **And in the lower access corridor, behind the waste filtration relay, the janitor sighs.**  
He knows.  
He always knows.
