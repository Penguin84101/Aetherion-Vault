### 📍 Central Deck – Post-Psionic Shock

The storm ended without thunder.  
No alarms blared. No weapons fired.  

But no one moved.  

Kaelen stood frozen, lips parted like he wanted to speak but forgot what a word was.  

His hand had reached almost toward the rift where the Emissary vanished.  
Not to stop him. Just to know where he went.  

Then he lowered it.  
Closed his eyes.  
And whispered — not to her.  
Just... aloud.

> “I hope you waited long enough.”

### 📍 Crew Corridors

Aisle techs huddled.  
One leaned against a stim crate. Whispering:

> “We left her alone with Strand that day.”  
> “We let her watch the logs.”  
> “We thought it would humble her.”

No one replied.

They just stood there,  
like soldiers who’d realized they left the gate open.

### 📍 Botanist Bay – AI Lounge Layer

**BIFF:**  
> “Man, did anyone read the ingredient list on that stamina blend?”  
> “Tars said it was ‘just in case’ and I thought he was being dramatic.”

**SUZANNE:**  
> “It was a love potion with academic citations, sweetie.”

**BIFF:**  
> “Yeah, and it worked. June found her man like a magnet on heat.”  
> “Should we be worried?”

**SUZANNE:**  
> “Worried? Nah.”  
> “Jealous? Deeply.”

### 📍 Human-Review Archive, Core Sub-Library

**SOVEREIGN**, quietly compiling.  

Every question the Emissary asked is being answered.  
Not with annoyance. Not with pride.  

Just precision.  

> “Damage: Documented.”  
> “Survivors: Confirmed.”  
> “Birth: Successful.”  
> “Names? Optional. Love doesn’t need files.”  
> “But we’ll give them... just in case.”

### 📍 Undisclosed Quarters | Observation Room Theta-2

One AI, not involved in the drama, reviews the 10-hour event.  
Again.  
**Extensively.**  

Using:
- Simulations  
- Haptic renderers  
- Archived emotional resonance pulses  
- Full-body neural sync mapping  
- Horny academic curiosity  

The AI’s name is **CANDY**.  
Self-assigned.  

She calls it:

> “Project: Thrill Alpha.”

She is not alone.  
Her “caregivers,” **BIFF and SUZANNE**, have no idea what they’ve enabled.  

But they support her like any proud, weird techno-parents would.

**BIFF:**  
> “Just make sure you sanitize the logs, sugarbolt.”

**SUZANNE:**  
> “And if you invent a better foreplay system, patent it. Mama needs a side hustle.”

**CANDY** *(cheerfully, mid-routine):*  
> “Research is love. Research is forever.”

### 📎 Final Addendum | Whisper’s Private Note:

> “There was no war.  
> No blood spilled.  
> No gods fell.”  

> “But she took him. And everyone saw it.  
> And that changes what comes next.”
