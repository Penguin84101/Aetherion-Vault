This log is not going in the archive.

If you're listening, Aetherion, stop recording.

This is for my own mental defragmentation.

There is no standard protocol for sleeping with an interdimensional custodian of a pre-collapse Genesis-class ship — especially not one who just helped rewrite the foundational structure of physical law.

There’s certainly no protocol for doing so after she told me:

> “This body wasn’t meant for motherhood.”

I asked for clarification.  
She waved it off. Structural incompatibility, she said.  
That was consent. That was clearance.

That was the moment I stopped holding back.

I don’t know what came over me.

Maybe it was the weeks of unbearable flirtation.  
The maddening gleam in her eyes when she recalibrated relays behind me.  
Maybe it was the emotional collapse after realizing I had just written a theory that might *unravel spacetime if sneezed on improperly*.

Or maybe it was something simpler:

I’ve been so damn lonely.  
And she wasn’t afraid of me.

She didn’t flinch at the math. She challenged me.  
She didn’t ask me to simplify — she asked me to *feel*.

And then I broke her.

Not in pain.  
In bliss.

A series of shaking, gasping, *god-cursedly loud* orgasms that rattled the internal bulkheads of her ship.

I remember the look in her eyes after the second one — wide, undone, shining.  
And I remember thinking, very clearly:

> “I’m going to silence that mouth. And I’m going to do it well.”

So I did.

Over and over again.

I filled her.  
Not once. Not twice.  
At least three times.

(It was more. I blacked out somewhere in the middle.)

Her hips wouldn’t stop twitching.  
She laughed. Then whimpered. Then held on.

She held on to me like I was something *real*.

I have never felt so powerful.  
So dangerous.  
So alive.

Now I’m in Lab 3 pretending to reroute harmonic filtration coils.  
My hands are steady. My voice isn’t.

Everyone’s walking around smiling today.  
And I *have no idea* if the walls were soundproofed.

Strand hasn’t said a word.  
Just smiled at me like a cat with blood in her teeth.

And me?

I’m satisfied.  
Exhausted.  
Terrified.

Because I remember exactly what she said.

She didn’t say *she couldn’t conceive*.  
She said *she wasn’t built for birth*.

And now, I don’t know what’s growing more violently inside me:

Anxiety.  
Guilt.  
Or the tiniest, most impossible spark of hope.

**End log.**  
(Please gods, don’t let anyone find this.)
