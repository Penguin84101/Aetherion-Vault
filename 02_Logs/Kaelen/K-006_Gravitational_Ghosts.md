The incident left scars deeper than the hull. No casualties on our side, though several individuals sustained injuries.

While I continue gravitational resonance experiments with Strand’s hammer — *The Aetherion*, as **he** got used to call it — the station’s teams have been evaluating structural damage and salvaging what remains of the ship.

The ship is… dead.  
Not from battle, but from something older. Like it cooled past function.
Strand insists, *“It’s resting.”*  
I don't have the heart to retort.

Its gravitic core — if it is a core at all — is fused. Silent. No signal. No spin.  
And inside the warped framework, we found the impossible: **raw Kinesium**.

That material is more legend than element. It’s only been documented in six star-system incidents across two centuries — mostly rumor, filtered through black protocols.

What little we know:

**Primo**. Absorbs and redirects kinetic energy with frightening efficiency.
**Secundo**. Responds to neural activity, though the mechanism remains unknown.
**Tertio**. Becomes violently unstable under high thermal exposure.

And now we have an entire ship *made of it.* Or at least, laced through it like veins of intention.

Strand couldn’t explain. He said simply:

> *“I fly it. It listens. Or it doesn’t.”*

Our engineers can’t interface with it.  
Tools rebound. Energy disperses. Even scanners misalign near its structure — bending calibration like magnets to memory.  
It’s as if the ship resists being measured... the same way the hammer resisted being named.

I suspect Kinesium doesn’t just conduct. It *remembers*.  
It doesn’t amplify motion — it *stores* it.  
Intention becomes inertia.

Which leads me to an irresistible hypothesis:

> **What if Kinesium is Aetherion-tuned matter — solidified resonance from a collapse event?**  
> And what if it remembers force?

I must tread carefully.

Strand is not a threat. But the tools in his possession are.  
Or worse: they may only be *partially* understood, even by him.

And still…

I offered access to our deep-lab resonance bays.  
Because I need to see what happens when Kinesium is exposed to gravitational stress inside an Aetherion-aligned vacuum.

If it resonates… we may glimpse a new state of matter.  
If it fractures… we may tear a hole in what we thought was real.
