**[The room is dim.]**

The sheets are a mess.  
Kaelen is still shirtless, his datapad pushed aside.  
Strand lies beside him, breathing steady, hand on her belly.

She stirs. Slowly.  
Eyes flick open.

---

**STRAND (hoarse):**  
You stayed awake.

**KAELEN (smiling faintly):**  
Hard to sleep when you’ve just been classified a “fertility archetype.”

*Pause. Her smirk is lazy but sharp. He’s trying to play it cool. Failing.*

**STRAND (teasing):**  
I take it… Eris talked?

**KAELEN:**  
She bragged.  
In front of an AI conference call.

**STRAND (chuckling):**  
She always did have a loud mouth for a ghost.

*Silence.*

---

**KAELEN (quietly):**  
Is it true?

**STRAND:**  
Yes.

**KAELEN:**  
And you're okay?

**STRAND (beat):**  
**I will be.**

---

She shifts, pulling the sheet around herself.  
Not from modesty — from weight.  
Her body, usually radiant and assertive, seems **anchored** now.  
Not weak. Just… full.

---

**STRAND:**  
My body was designed for war.  
Stealth, endurance, kinetic resilience, multi-sensory terrain analysis.  
It was never made to carry life to term.

Not safely.

**KAELEN:**  
But you are carrying it.  
Us.

**STRAND:**  
Yes.  

*Because I built the failsafe.*

She nods toward the fabrication wing, far beyond the wall.

**STRAND:**  
**LifeBubble.**  
Midway transfer. Non-invasive.  
It’ll cradle what I can’t.

If it finishes in time.

---

**KAELEN (quiet):**  
And if it doesn’t?

*Her pause is long. Her jaw tightens.*

**STRAND (smiling, but cracked):**  
Then I die.

---

**KAELEN:**  
You shouldn’t have done this alone.

**STRAND (barely audible):**  
I’m used to alone.

**KAELEN:**  
You don’t have to be.

**STRAND:**  
I know.  
That’s what scares me.

---

She turns toward him.  
She’s not smiling now — not the way he’s used to.  
Her voice loses its armor.

**STRAND:**  
I come from… a place we no longer know.  
A drift-shard caught in this galaxy’s slow spiral.

I fell here.  
Literally.  
We don’t *map* like you do.

If I can’t find my origin, I may be the last.  
A war-echo with no banner. A ghost.  
A ***stray.***

**KAELEN (whispering):**  
You’re not a ghost.

**STRAND (grinning through it):**  
You’re just saying that because you knocked me up hard enough to rewrite my immune system.

**KAELEN (groans, covers face):**  
Oh gods. You’re actually teasing me about this.

**STRAND (mock-innocent):**  
Want to know how the birth control *should’ve* worked?

**KAELEN (deadpan):**  
Not if it’s going to end with the phrase “sperm spearheaded through nanite field and stormed the gates.”

**STRAND (also deadpan):**  
Huh… that’s… roughly accurate.

---

My birth control was indeed nanite-based. Adaptive shielding.  
Intended to repel even aggressive genetic vectors.

But *your* contribution?

Biologically irrational.  
Statistically obscene.

**KAELEN (groaning):**  
You’re not mad?

**STRAND (softly):**  
No.  
I let it happen.  
*I felt it happen.*

---

She touches her stomach.

**STRAND:**  
That moment…  
when I stopped resisting — it wasn’t failure.  
It was **choice**.

I don’t regret it.

Even if it kills me.

---

**KAELEN (reaching out, taking her hand):**  
I do.  
If I lose you… I—

**STRAND (cutting in, fierce):**  
Then help me *finish* the chamber.  
Help me build the future.  
Not mourn the possibility.

---

*They lie in silence. She turns toward him. He presses his forehead to hers.*  
*The stars beyond the window hum gently.*
