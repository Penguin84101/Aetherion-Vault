Kaelen didn’t speak.

He didn’t need to.

Strand’s body remained still — too still for someone once made of fury, momentum, and blood.

The treatment was finished. Her body healed, inside and out. Her breathing was soft. Normal. *Textbook normal*, according to the AIs.

But Kaelen could feel her mind shifting — like someone trying to pull on a reversed sweater in their sleep.

**Almost ready. Almost.**

So he wrote. Faster.

Reports. Theories. Data digests. Anything to keep his hands from shaking.

The others stayed quiet. Out of respect. Or fear.

Kaelen wasn’t sure what he felt. When her psychic signature went still, it was like the chains on his soul had snapped.

Not freedom.  
Just… emptiness.

Still, he kept writing.

*Prepare Mental Resonance Protocol II* — that was PHAESTON-Δ's suggestion, the AI assigned to psychological well-being.

The theory was sound: if her body was whole, but her mind caught in a survival loop, then maybe a new kind of input — something intimate, something encoded — could break the softlock. Or at least stir her.

**But why writing?**  
He’d spoken aloud. He’d whispered. Pleaded. Touched her hand.

Nothing.

What would words on a datapad do that his voice couldn’t?

He didn’t have an answer.  
But he didn’t have anything better either.

So he wrote.

Not reports.  
Not whitepapers.  
Not logs.

**His heart.**

He poured it out, one keystroke at a time — until the knot in his throat choked him.

He wrote until he couldn’t.

> “You told me I’d never understand what it’s like —  
> To hold power, and feel it leave.  
> To carry everyone and everything, even when your body breaks.
>
> You were right.  
> I didn’t understand.
>
> But I’m learning.
>
> I held you when you were shaking.  
> I saw your body do the impossible.  
> I saw your courage become silence.
>
> And now I hold what you gave me.  
> The part of you that still grows.  
> The part of us.
>
> You don’t need to come back to me for my sake.
>
> Come back because the stars still want your stories.  
> Come back because your child’s heartbeat sounds like a drum.  
> Come back because the ship misses you.  
> Because *I* miss you.

> I’ll be here.  
> Until the sun dies, if that’s what it takes.”

There were no lights.  
No flashes.  
No sound.

But the message left.

It didn’t travel like light or electrons.

No logs. No packet ID. No checksum.

Just intent. Just Kaelen.  
Encoded in soulwire tones and psionic drift — burned into the link that binds her…

Not **body to body** —  
But **purpose to purpose**.

The **Core-Womb** hummed once.

And somewhere…  
within the stormforest of deeper dreaming…

**She heard it.**
