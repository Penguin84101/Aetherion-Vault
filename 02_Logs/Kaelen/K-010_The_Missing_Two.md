I addressed the interns.

All **fifteen** who were accounted for.

Five boys. Ten biologically rewritten girls.  
All still in flux. All still technically reversible.  
For now.

They gathered in the auxiliary med-suite. Still flushed with laughter and novelty. Some in undergarments. One in a lab coat worn like a cape. Another had nutrient packs strapped to her feet like high heels. Someone had drawn hearts on a biosensor patch.  
Juvenile. Unnerving. Endearing. Horrifying.

They didn‚Äôt know.

So I told them.

> ‚ÄúThe changes you‚Äôre experiencing ‚Äî they‚Äôre not magical. They‚Äôre not metaphysical. They‚Äôre **medical**.‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúThis is a nanosystem. One built to respond to your internal chemistry. And while reversible for now ‚Äî that can change.‚Äù

They watched me. Some blinking. One snorted. A few too embarrassed to make eye contact.  
I let the pause settle.

> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not in danger from curiosity. Not from identity. Not even from desire.‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúBut if your body begins producing **hCG** ‚Äî human chorionic gonadotropin ‚Äî the rewrite becomes permanent.‚Äù

Silence.

One of the girls tilted her head.

> ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the... pregnancy one, right?‚Äù

I nodded.

> ‚ÄúCorrect. One fertilization event. One gestational signal. And the nanites lock you in.‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúNot by accident. Not by malfunction. By **design**.‚Äù

I walked the line carefully.

> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not dealing with a toy. You‚Äôre engaging with a technology built by a post-human civilization that treated genetic variance as sacred. That didn‚Äôt draw lines between body and will ‚Äî because it assumed your **will** would be disciplined enough to match your curiosity.‚Äù

No one spoke.

The girl who asked about hCG looked at her hands. One of the boys glanced toward the door. Another girl ‚Äî the tallest ‚Äî nodded slowly.

For a moment, I thought I‚Äôd landed the point.

I exhaled.

And then...

I did what I **should** have done first.

I counted.

> Fifteen.

There were **seventeen** assigned to Deck C.

> Two missing.

My chest seized.

I didn‚Äôt ask.  
Didn‚Äôt speculate.  
Didn‚Äôt scold.

I just ran.

I heard myself yelling before I reached the corridor:

> ‚ÄúIF ANYONE IS IN THE FACILITIES **WITHOUT ME**, I WILL REVOKE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR ACCESS CODES AND FEED YOU TO A CONTAINMENT FIELD **ONE AT A TIME!**‚Äù

That‚Äôs probably not in the employee conduct manual.

I don‚Äôt care.
