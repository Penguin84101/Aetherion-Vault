[Room: Dim. Quiet. Only their voices and the low pulse of ambient resonance.]

---

**STRAND** *(lying back, voice calm)*:  
> “I can feel her shift. Not like a kick. Not even movement. Just... pressure.  
> Like a ripple through something inside me I didn’t know had depth.”

**KAELEN** *(sitting nearby, barefoot, shoulders tense)*:  
> “You’re sure it’s a ‘she’?”

**STRAND** *(smirks faintly)*:  
> “The same way I’m sure my left hand exists.  
> And that you ruin gods.”

[Silence. Kaelen runs a hand through his hair.]

---

**KAELEN**:  
> “We still have... what? Three weeks before the risk window closes.  
> LifeBubble protocols hold until then.”

**STRAND**:  
> “Too long.”  
>  
> “We should do it before the emissary arrives. Before the story becomes someone else’s.  
> Before the world claws its way into our hands and starts asking questions we aren’t ready to answer.”

**KAELEN** *(nods, softly)*:  
> “I thought the same. Not out of fear.  
> Just... instinct. Like she deserves to be safe before the storm lands.”

[A beat. She turns her head toward him.]

---

**STRAND**:  
> “You keep doing that.”

**KAELEN** *(blinks)*:  
> “What?”

**STRAND**:  
> “Matching me.  
> Saying the thing I haven’t said yet.  
> Like you’re reading over my shoulder in real time.”

[He breathes.]

**KAELEN**:  
> “Maybe I am.”

[Pause. The hum of the Aetherion layer is faint. Subtle.]

---

**STRAND**:  
> “We met, what, a few weeks ago?  
> I barely remember how. A crash. A flare. You bleeding. Me pissed.”  
>  
> “It feels like a whole lifetime compressed into days.”

**KAELEN**:  
> “Like time folded over on itself and we just... lived through the crease.”

[She laughs quietly.]

---

**STRAND**:  
> “I didn’t expect to feel anything like this again.  
> Not since I lost my first body. The one I was born in.  
> Everything after was utility. Strength. Combat-readiness.”  
>  
> “I forgot what it was like to be held gently.”

**KAELEN** *(softly)*:  
> “You don’t have to be strong in this room.”

[Longer silence.]

---

**STRAND**:  
> “And yet I want to be. For her.”  
>  
> “She’ll need to know this wasn’t a mistake.  
> That she wasn’t born from desperation or a glitch in old code.”

**KAELEN**:  
> “She’ll know.”  
> “We’ll make sure she has more than we did.”  
> “She’ll have a story. Not a warning.”

**STRAND** *(voice fragile, but steady)*:  
> “What if I don’t make it?”

[Kaelen stands. Crosses to her. Kneels. Takes her hand.]

**KAELEN**:  
> “You will.  
> But if not... she’ll still have you.  
> In every breath. In every word she speaks.”  
>  
> “And you’ll have me.”

[She squeezes his hand.]

**STRAND** *(barely audible)*:  
> “...Then we’ll name her.”  
> “Not now. But soon.”

**KAELEN**:  
> “I’d like that.”

[No more words. The room fades to silence. One heartbeat. Then another.]
