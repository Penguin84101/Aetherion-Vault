We were not meant to witness violence in this place.  
This station was built for silence, for the deep listening of realityâ€™s breath. But today, silence was broken by something that does not belong to any known law.

The intruders came swift, equipped with dampened kinetics and null-mass armor. Saboteurs or scavengers â€” we still donâ€™t know. The security drones failed to respond in time. But something else intervened.

A figure. Unidentified.  
Holding what I hesitate to call a weapon.

At first glance: a rod of wood or something like wood, fibrous but lightless, matte and grainless like petrified bone.  
Orbiting it: a metallic-like fluid. Not magnetic. Not reacting to any form of electromagnetism. It hovered, as if tracing some invisible orbital lattice.

The wielder raised it â€” not swung, but invoked it. And at the moment of impact, the fluid collapsed, formed, solidified into a hammerhead. Not a tool. Not a weapon. A will made real. Each blow shattered limbs and armor alike.

But what shook me most was this:  
Every time the hammer struck, the Aetherion containment arrays flared.

Not a cascade. Not a breach. Just a resonance.  
Like the force that shaped the weapon echoed through the Aetherion field.

Who built this device? Is it made... or grown?  
And most disturbingly:  
**Is the weapon drawing on Aetherion... or is it a byproduct?**

I am grateful the danger was repelled. But I can no longer say we are alone in this discovery.

Somewhere, someone has already mastered what we are still trying to name.

**End log.**
