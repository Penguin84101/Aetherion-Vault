There are sections of the ship that still answer to spanners and sealant, thank the void.

I’ve rerouted kinesium filaments through Deck A’s shielding lattice. The stabilizers will hum when the flare comes — that’s the theory — assuming we don’t rupture spacetime like gift wrap pulled too hard.

There’s still no formal cockpit. No fusion chamber. No nav array in any recognizable sense. But I’ve mapped enough sensory nodes and harmonic relays to know where the pulse will anchor.

The ship is waking.

And I am so tired.

I crawled under something that looked like a pulmonary duct but pulsed like a nervous system. There were threads of light moving like breath. One of them hummed when I touched it — like it recognized me. Like it missed me.

I said something flippant. I forget what.

And then she said something back.

**Strand.**

She sat beside me, arms on knees, chin resting in her hands like a schoolchild watching a very slow puzzle. Her eyes glowed faintly. Not metaphor. Actual glow. Probably resonance response. Maybe just the lighting.

She said:

> “You fix things like you’re afraid of being useful.”

I told her I fix things because they’re broken.

She smirked. Reached over. Adjusted a tool I didn’t realize I’d been holding backward.

> “You know it doesn’t need all this, right? You’re just giving it an excuse to wake up for you.”

Then she sat closer. Close enough to hum against me.

> “The ship wants you in it. I think it likes you. I know I do.”

I told her I wasn’t sure if that was a compliment or a psychological hazard.

She asked if I always deflect with sarcasm when seduced by cosmically-tuned interstellar pilgrims.

I dropped the hydro-spanner.

She laughed. That warm, low kind of laugh that gets into your bones and stays there.

And I — a rational man — did the dumbest thing imaginable:

I leaned in.

Not far. Not decisive. Just… closer.

She met me halfway.

And then — the silence that wasn’t really silence, just a drop in the ship’s hum. The way the air thickened between us. Her fingers touched my collar.

And I realized I had nothing.

No fusion tape.  
No thermal patch.  
No glitter filter.  
**No condoms.**

I pulled back. I think I muttered something about medical compliance protocols and sterilization barriers and crew policy.

She blinked at me like I’d just suggested building trust using a fire extinguisher and a broken spreadsheet.

> “You think I need a rubber band and a government sticker to love you?” she asked.

I told her I didn’t know what I needed.

She said:

> “Maybe just *wanting* is enough.”

I didn’t kiss her.

Not yet.

But I stayed beside her, in the half-lit hallway of a ship that was starting to dream again.

And for once, the silence was okay.

(*Unless I vanish in the resurrection flare, in which case: hi. Yes, this happened. It was good.*)
