Footsteps. Pacing. Pacing again.

**KAELEN:**  
This floor tile’s gonna get a groove worn into it.  
Isn’t there a superstition about that? Pacing holes in the world and falling in?  
Wouldn’t be the first time I fell.

He stops, breathes. Touches the wall. Feels its warmth.

She’s in there.

Not her-her — not the hammer-swinging goddess who saved the base.  
Not the smirking storm who teases me like I’m a kitten trying to mount a lioness.

She’s in there, but not for war.  
For… something she never trained for.  
Something none of us could’ve trained for.

**Birth.**  
No — pre-birth.  
A handoff.  
A transfer.

Of what?  
Of her strength. Her blood. Her story.

**And I gave her that.**  
Me.

He chuckles once. Dry.

Gods. I’d laugh if I wasn’t so—  
It’s funny, isn’t it?

This unstoppable being. This celestial chaos wrapped in skin and cocky lines and radiant, impossible motion.  
**This one.**  
Couldn’t handle her own biology.

And I—  
I just flirted back.  
I wasn’t trying to start a lineage.  
I was trying to survive the day.  
She made me feel like I was wanted. Not just useful. Not just a body in a uniform.  
Like I was the gravity in her orbit.

And now her blood’s too delicate to hold what we made.  
Her body’s in retreat, and we had to move our child to the safest place in this godforsaken galaxy — the heart of her ship.

That’s the irony, right?  
**The war-goddess felled by a womb.**  
And me, the half-wrecked man she toyed with, pacing like some idiot waiting room dad from a soap opera.

I shouldn’t have let it happen.  
I shouldn’t have said yes.  
But…

**I couldn’t say no.**  
And I wouldn’t, not now.

He sits down, finally, back against the wall. A hand over his mouth. Another pause.

If I lose her—  
If something goes wrong in there, and I lose her—  
I don’t even know who to scream at.  
The stars? The AI? Myself?

She told me this was fate.  
That she knew.

I just thought fate would wait for us to have a damn coffee together first.

Silence. A long one.

Okay.  
Okay.  
**Deep breath.**

The AI said it’s going smooth.  
**Too** smooth. That kind of smooth that makes my spine itch.  
But she’s got Aphra. She’s got Odu’s team. The best we’ve got.

**And she’s got me.**

Not in there. But here.  
Pacing. Praying. Loving her so hard it hurts.

She’ll come back.  
She has to.

Because if she doesn’t—  
Then I swear to every star that ever birthed a world:  
**I’ll raise our child with fire in their bones.**  
**And joy in their heart.**  
**And the kind of strength she gave me without ever asking for mine.**

He stands. Puts a hand against the sealed door.

> “I’m here, love.”  
> “I’m not leaving.”  
> “Come back to us.”
