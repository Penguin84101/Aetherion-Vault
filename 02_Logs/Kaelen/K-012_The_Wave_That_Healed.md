plot_hooks:
  - Successful temporary unification of the major physical forces via Aetherion mediation.
  - Emotional intent triggers a system-wide Genesis Engine activation.
  - A mass healing event occurs across the base — physical and psychological.
  - Kaelen confronts Strand, but cannot bring himself to accuse her.
  - The base enters a quiet, profound shift — and Kaelen halts his experiments.

The integration of **electromagnetism** into the harmonic lattice was — *on paper* — impossible.

Even with Aetherion acting as a bridging medium, the oscillatory dissonance between gravitational curvature and electromagnetic phase spirals should have torn the field apart.

But it didn’t.

Using legacy electroweak unification frameworks — Heisenberg–Weinberg–Salam baselines — and compensating with kinetic-damping shells of *purified kinesium*, I created a synthetic field symmetry that **held**.

Not just stabilized. Not just observed.

**Held.**

A moment where the universe’s pillars — weak force, strong force, kinetic, gravitic, and electromagnetic — folded into **coherence**.

---

And in that moment...  
I let myself feel.

Not about the math.  
Not about the paper I’ll never publish.  
Not the grant board that cut us loose when the lockdown began.

I thought about the crew.

About **Faye**, still smiling like she doesn’t believe she’s allowed to.

About **Cam**, who tried to apologize by assembling a bouquet from hex bolts and emergency meal packets.

About the engineers — from four worlds — who built a functioning neutrino-tether without agreeing on what a *wrench* was.

And I thought:

> “Let them be okay.”

Not productive. Not rational. Not even scientific.

Just a pure, *human* wish.

> “Let them be healed.”  
> “Let them be seen.”  
> “Let them live.”

---

The Engine responded.

Not with sound.  
Not with warning.

But with a **tide**.

A wave of tardigrade-encoded nanites — larger than any we’ve logged — burst outward like a breath. Pale gold and coral light, flowing through the station like mist.

It passed through **walls**.  
Through **steel**.  
Through **us**.

---

It passed through **me**.

I felt it enter my chest. My leg. My hand.

And when I reached for my crutch...

I didn’t need it.

I stood.
Walked three steps.
No pain. No hesitation.

The fracture — **gone**.

📍 **Base-Wide Report: Bio-Stabilization Pulse**

Engineering: old scars gone.  
Medical: chronic fatigue reversed.  
Deck B: one technician regained full hearing.  
Deck G: early-stage neurofibrillary clusters vanished from the cognitive map.

No one reported discomfort.  
Some just said they felt… *lighter*. Others wept.

Wrinkles faded.  
Tremors steadied.  
Back pain eased.  
Memories, long buried in trauma, surfaced **gently**.

Not erased.  
Just... **put down**.

---

The experiment paused itself.
No alarms. No errors. Just... stillness.

Like the station **knew** it was complete.
Or maybe *I* was.

---

I left the lab. Walked in silence.

Past Medbay — where the laughter had returned.  
Past diagnostics — where someone played music too loud and no one complained.

Down to the chamber where Strand lives.

Where her ship purrs in sleep.  
Where her ridiculous teakettle whistles just shy of boiling.  
Where she wears that smug look instead of saying “hello.”

---

I didn’t sit.

I asked:

> “Did you know this would happen?”

She raised one eyebrow — like a cat watching you knock over your own wine glass.

> “Did you *plan* this?”

She shrugged. Poured tea. Pushed a cup toward me.

I wanted to yell.
To quote regulations. To bring charts.

To scream about **autonomy**, **consent**, **consequences**.

But I couldn’t.

Because she didn’t look smug anymore.

She just looked... calm.  
Like all of this had already happened.

Like we were just catching up.

---

I took the tea.

I didn’t thank her.

But I drank it.

---

I have no further experiments planned tonight.

**End log.**
