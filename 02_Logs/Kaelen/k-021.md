> “I don't usually do voice logs like this.  
> I process through math. Through systems. Through movement.”

> “But the station is still.  
> And I needed to talk to someone. Or no one. Maybe just the hum.”

> “Strand is asleep now.  
> If the universe is kind — she stays that way long enough to live.”

> “She’d hate me saying it like that.  
> But she’s not here to glare at me, so I get to be honest.”

> “I didn’t plan on this.  
> Any of it.  
> Not the theory. Not the crash. Not her.”

> “I was just trying to find answers. To fix things. To survive.”

> “And then she survived me.”

> “She carried this child because she chose to.  
> Not because she had to.  
> Not because I asked her to.  
> But because we happened, and she said yes to it — even knowing the cost.”

> “I don’t know what I am now.  
> Not really.  
> People around me glow. They bend machines.  
> I just... keep going.”

> “But if I could choose again…  
> I’d still fall.  
> I’d still crash.  
> I’d still meet her.”

> “And I’d still love her.  
> Even if it meant watching her sleep like this.”

> “Wake up, Strand.  
> Or don’t.  
> Just know I’m here either way.”
