📓 **Log Entry | Dr. Kaelen Rho, Quantum Theorist | ORBITAL ARRAY STATION IX-3**  
**Entry 5522 – [UTC 22.07.2291 | 6 hours after the Event]**

After Strand's explanation, I needed to verify. To see for myself.  
I logged a welfare check.

Deck C.
The intern wing.

Seventeen of them — ages fourteen to nineteen — stationed here for mentorship rotation.  
Most mid-puberty. All within the exposure radius.

I tried not to expect chaos.  
I failed.

---

It was... normal.

**Too** normal.

Music filtered through a comm emitter. Laughter echoed off the bulkheads.  
Someone was balancing equipment crates like heels while striking a runway pose.

Several interns — now biologically female — had repurposed lab coats into improvised gowns.  
Diagnostic pens projected glitter tattoos. Old dataslates became scepters.

It was a fashion show. A chaos ritual.

One struck a dramatic pose. Another commented on “shelf space” with delight and confusion.  
They were trying names, walks, gestures — mimicking each other in real-time, curious and bold.

Six boys — still male — lingered at the edge. Not watching. *Watching*.  
One leaned in and muttered to another:

> “Actually kinda hot.”

> “Looks female enough.”

They both went quiet when they saw me.  
I scanned them. No genome lock. Good.

One girl — tall, silver hair now flowing freely — turned, grinned, and said:

> “Bet we could try these bodies out. You know. For science.”

Another chimed in, laughing:

> “What’s the worst that could happen? Get us pregnant?”

More laughter. Nervous. Curious. Raw.

> “Actually, could we?”

> “Wait — is that even a thing?”

> “I mean, we’re not even wired for that... right? This is just a Basic. It even has the viral inhibitor and the timer.”

They were joking.
Clearly.
Unaware.

I scowled. They stopped.

I ran quick bioscans. Logged samples.  
Ignored whispers about hips and braids.  
Cataloged residual nanite fog still faint in the air.

Then I bolted for the medical wing.

📍 **Medical Wing, IX-3**

I uploaded the collected data.  
Cross-referenced it with existing nanite interaction models.

Gene expression shifting wasn’t new — basic transformation kits had been around for decades.  
Replicas of old tech from the *Wolf* still sell on the capital. Functional. Predictable.

But this?

This was older. *Sharper*. More sophisticated. And infinitely more dangerous.

The AI parsed the samples. Fast. Too fast.

📑 **Hormonal Correlation Matrix: Rewrite Lock Triggers**

- Luteinizing Hormone (LH): ❌ No lock  
- Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH): ❌ No lock  
- Estrogen/Testosterone fluctuations: ❌ No lock  
- Oxytocin/Norepinephrine spikes: ❌ No lock  
- **Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG): ✅ Confirmed Lock-In Trigger**

**hCG.** The pregnancy hormone.

That voice. That grin.

> “What’s the worst that could happen?”

That’s when I stopped breathing.

**Pregnancy stabilizes the transformation.**  
Not puberty. Not identity. Not desire.

**Pregnancy.**

I stared at the terminal.

And then it hit me.

_The logs._  
_A transient resonance spike — timestamped 0427. Source: unassigned._  
_No alarms. No alerts. Not even Aphra flagged it._  
_I dismissed it — static, background noise._  
_In hindsight... maybe I shouldn’t have._

The timing.  
The silence.  
The shape of the event.

The ship had answered — **before I even knew we’d asked the question.**

---

I sprinted back toward Deck C.

I don’t remember shouting.  
I don’t remember who I aimed the words at.

> “NO ONE GETS PREGNANT ON MY STATION!”

Maybe I said it to the corridor.  
Maybe to the ceiling.  
Maybe to the universe.  
Maybe just to myself.

Maybe it was a threat.  
Maybe it was a prayer.  
Maybe it was already too late.

**End log.**
