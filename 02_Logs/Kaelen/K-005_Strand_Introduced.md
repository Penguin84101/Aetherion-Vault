We’ve begun to speak.  
The wielder — if he can be called that — though “custodian” feels more apt, remains unlisted in any registry. His biological markers return null across galactic species banks. No match in the xenotype archives. No lineage, no homeworld, no designation.

Yet he speaks. Our translators render his voice with startling clarity — calm, formal, even poetic at times. He refers to himself only as "Strand".

His ship is barely more than an outer hull, charred and cracked along non-Euclidean seams. There are no control surfaces. The interior reacts to his presence, possibly intention. He claims he did not build it.

When I showed him the Aetherion resonance maps, his gaze lingered not in curiosity, but in recognition. He tapped a gloved finger to the harmonic glyphs and murmured:

> “So this is the name you have given it... Aetherion. It has many names, but this one sings well.”

He has since begun referring to his weapon by the same name — not a title of invention, but of reverence. “The Aetherion.” He pronounces it with an almost liturgical weight.

The staff, now stored under layered containment, still resists classification. Its core material remains unreadable by spectroscopy — possibly older than planetary formation itself. The fluid, when at rest, maintains orbit around the shaft without centrifugal energy.

We’ve offered repairs to his ship. He accepted with a small bow.  
In return, I asked to observe controlled demonstrations of the hammer.  
He agreed on one condition:

> “You will not record the internal feeling. Only the external form. Some things must be remembered, not measured.”

Strand is polite. Grateful, even. But there’s a silence in him too — still, too vast.

I do not believe angering him would be wise.

We call him a guest. But in truth, we are hosts to something far older than science.
