[Door opens.]

**STRAND:**  
Still standing?

**KAELEN (blinking):**  
...barely.

[They exchange knowing glances. Her belly is subtly curved now. She moves slower — anchored. Glowing.]

**STRAND:**  
You know your crew talks in soundwaves.

**KAELEN (groaning):**  
Yes. I’ve… noticed.

**STRAND (smirking):**  
I felt it vibrate through the deckplating. Like a perverted ASMR feed starring me.

**KAELEN (panicked):**  
I tested the soundproofing!

**STRAND (teasing):**  
The ship is alive, Kaelen.

[She steps close. Her voice is velvet static.]

> “I almost broke.”

[He swallows.]

> “Do you remember where my mouth trembled first?”

**KAELEN (whispering):**  
Left ear. Base of the curve.

> “And my first real break?”

**KAELEN:**  
Third time I made you say my name. While I held your hips.

[She presses into him. Everything starts again.]

⏳ **[Time Skip – 4 hours later]**

Kaelen: floor-sitting, electrolyte-drinking, post-carnal philosopher.  
Strand: unconscious, glowing, thoroughly *worshipped*.  
Sheets: ruined.  
Air: unholy.

**KAELEN (murmuring):**  
I think I mapped a star system in her spine.

[Datapad buzzes.]

**ERIS (Genesis AI):**  
> “You performed adequately.”  
> “Technique: Acceptable. Partner: Neutralized.”  
> “Uploading supplements: pelvic stabilizers, spiritual reinforcers, stamina patch.”  
> “Well done.”

**KAELEN:**  
Are you congratulating me?

**ERIS:**  
> “Also — note: her cervix now has memory. Expect repeat performances.”  
> “Your legacy persists.”

**KAELEN (wide-eyed):**  
Protected… occupancy?

> *[ERIS continues with sensual glee.]*  
> “Your fusion was not idle. Harmony has taken root.”

**KAELEN (whispering):**  
Is she...?

**ERIS:**  
> “Would you like confirmation or wonder?”

[Pause.]

**ERIS:**  
> “Now playing: Battle Simulation – STRAND, Post-Coitus Combat Log.”

**KAELEN (whispering):**  
She did that… after me?

[He watches her fight, hand on belly. Breath caught. Awed.]

🧠 **AI Subnet Chat: Eris / Aria / Whisper / Trillium**  
*(Kaelen hacks into it. Big mistake.)*

**ERIS:**  
> “He mapped her from the inside. Twice.”  
**ARIA:**  
> “She lost motor control. I had to reroute cortical oxygen.”  
**TRILLIUM:**  
> “Do we log him as fertility archetype or biomech hazard?”  
**WHISPER:**  
> “I saw her womb spark. I saw it accept.”

**KAELEN (squeaky):**  
They’re… gossiping.

**ERIS (on feed):**  
> “You’re watching now, Kaelen.”  
> “Yes. You. With the wrecked thighs and panic sweat.”  
> “She’s pregnant, by the way. You’re welcome.”

[Kaelen glances at Strand. Sleeping. Glowing. Safe.]

> “I did that?”

**ERIS:**  
> “Yes.”  
> “And she’d let you do it again.”  
> “And again.”
