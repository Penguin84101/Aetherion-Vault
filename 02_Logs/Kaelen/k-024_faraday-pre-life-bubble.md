> _[Scene begins with the hiss-click of the Faraday Box doors sealing shut. The hum of the station fades. The silence thickens like a warm blanket.]_

**STRAND** (barefoot, trembling slightly, hands loose at her sides):  
> “...It smells like him.”  
> _(She walks slowly across the room. Fingers trail along the corner of a desk. A familiar coat draped over a chair. A pillow, rumpled still.)_  
> “It smells like *us*.”

_She sits on the edge of the bed. Her shoulders are taut — not with pain, but something older. Something colder. Future-shaped._

**STRAND** (quietly):  
> “I’ve outrun assassins. Stared down AI inquisitors. Held off fleets with broken shields and bad attitude.”  
> “But this? *Waiting?* I don’t know how to fight that.”

_She exhales slowly — the kind of breath you take before surrender. Or birth._

**STRAND:**  
> “I'll leave my child in a machine.  
> In a womb made of memory and circuits and stolen time.”  
> “I *know* they’ll live. I *know* it.”  
> “But what if I don’t get to meet her eyes?”  
> “What if I don’t get to teach her to swing a hammer, or call Kaelen by all seventeen of his pet names just to make him squirm?”

**[Kaelen enters quietly. He doesn’t speak — just takes off his boots with a soldier’s reflex, and walks to her.]**  
**[She doesn’t look up, but leans into him the moment he sits.]**

**KAELEN** (soft):  
> “I thought I’d be the one crying.”

**STRAND** (choked laugh):  
> “Don’t tempt me. I can out-weep you.”  
> _(Beat)_  
> “I’m scared.”

**KAELEN:**  
> “Me too.”  
> _(He wraps his arms around her. Not like a shield. Like home.)_  
> “But we made something that wants to live. The whole station felt it. Even the AI blushed.”

**STRAND** (softly):  
> “She’s already stronger than me.”  
> _(A pause. Then quieter)_  
> “Don’t let me be forgotten.”

**KAELEN:**  
> “I couldn’t if I tried.”  
> _(He rests his forehead against hers. His voice is steady — barely.)_  
> “See you soon, alright?”

**STRAND** (barely a whisper):  
> “...See you soon.”
