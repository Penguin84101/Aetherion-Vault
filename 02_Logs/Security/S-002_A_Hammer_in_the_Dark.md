📓 **Security Log | Cmdr. Lysa Vehl | ORBITAL ARRAY STATION IX-3**  
**Entry 1107 – [UTC 13.07.2291]**

---

It started at 0321 hours.

No warning. No flare. Just *pressure* — like the base took a breath it couldn’t exhale.

Eight intruders breached Deck E. No known insignia. No matching heat profiles. Too fast for clean response. They were armed and ready. We weren’t.

The first response team held the line for ninety seconds.

Then the power faltered. Hulls flexed. Communications jammed.

And the attackers started moving through the halls like they’d *mapped them*.

We were seconds from collapse.

Then... he arrived.

📍 **STRAND INTERVENTION RECORDED**

A man. Barefoot. Skinsuit torn. Eyes like he’d never blinked in his life. He held a weapon that shouldn’t exist — not by shape, not by density, not by **what it did**.

He moved like the station bent for him. Like physics forgot its rules.

And the hammer — if that’s what it is — answered.

The first assailant dropped mid-lunge. The second dissolved — **no contact made**.

The others tried to run.

The fight was over before I could speak.

📍 **Post-Mortem Notes: Anomalous Corpses**

The corpses — if that’s what they are — do not match any known humanoid configuration. No dermal patterns. Internals mismatch their exteriors. One had lungs where the jaw should be. Another had two hearts, neither in the right place.

Medical is classifying them as *“pseudo-humanoids of indeterminate classification.”* I call them something else:

**Warnings.**

This was not a raid. It was a **probe**.

And they were not fleeing toward us.  
They were fleeing *something else*.

Strand has not offered an explanation.

Neither has Kaelen.

But the hammer — **The Aetherion** — is now logged as a base-level protective artifact. I’ve placed two motion tripwires around its resting site.

The next time it’s raised, I want to be ready.

**End log.**

📍 **Addendum: Quarantine Observation Notice (Flag: Alpha-Level)**

I reviewed the incident again. And I noticed something buried in the system trail.

Somewhere in the Federation's anomaly network — the kind we’re not supposed to see — a flag tripped.  
**Level-1 Integrity Alert.** Passive quarantine protocols. No contact. No clarification.

Not a full lockdown. Not yet.  
Just… silence.

And I’ve learned the hard way that **silence from Command** is louder than any siren.

If another variable tips — if resonance breaches threshold, if the hammer sings again, if Strand’s presence warps the field too far — we won’t get a warning.

We’ll just go dark.

_End addendum._
