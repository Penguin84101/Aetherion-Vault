📍 **Signal Pull Summary – ORBITAL ARRAY STATION IX-3**

- Cross-departmental markers tripped:  
  - *Unclassified weapon use*  
  - *Biological rewriting via unlicensed vectors*  
  - *Chronocline instability confirmed*  
  - *Legacy artifact awakening – CODE: APHRODITE PATHWAY (unbound)*

- 17 days without formal report response despite four auto-pings from Sector ComNet.  
- No reply. No inquiry. No correction.

Conclusion:  
**They are either compromised, overwhelmed, or protecting something.**

📍 **Protocol Alignment: Legacy Echo Contingency**

> "Do not interfere until variance crosses 3.7σ in coherence waveforms."  
> "Do not trigger active quarantine unless vector breach is confirmed."

Current drift: **3.4σ**  
We are close.

📍 **Internal Subnote – Observational AI Subprocess**

> “Subject: Strand — Interference vector consistent with archived Bloom Survivors.”  
> “Cultural coding detected. Language matches pre-Babel encryption. Cross-referencing with Bloom Exodus logs.”  
> “Possible Genesis Core activity detected. Echo matches Aphrodite wave-keys.”

📎 *Note added to Black Box 004: “Keep watching. Don’t blink.”*

📍 **Final Summary:**

The station is changing.  
The people are changing.  
And the station hasn’t asked for help.

We’ve seen this pattern before.  
It ends in either transcendence — or silence.

No orders yet.  
But the sky is listening.

**End file.**
