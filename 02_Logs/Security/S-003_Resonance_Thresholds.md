  - Security acknowledges ongoing breaches in physical law across multiple decks.
  - Passive lockdown conditions seem to be creeping in from external sources.
  - Internal alarms begin to decouple from threat levels — unsettling the chain of command.
  - Introduces the idea that the station might be flagged for containment from the outside.
  - Hints that Kaelen’s experiments may have invited a much larger audience.

The hammer hasn't moved since the attack.  
Neither has my hand from the emergency alert panel.

I keep expecting a flare. A spike. A new breach.  
Instead, we get... drift.

Not explosions. Not chaos.  
Just *slow unraveling*.

The Song-Stones have spread. They're in the vents now.  
Spiral residue forming on the inner ring of the grav-core.  
One tech said it looked like frost. Another said it sounded like bone.

Sensors are syncing again. And not in any way that makes sense.

Deck A’s air filtration pings in rhythm with the geothermal stabilizers in Deck G.  
The comm relay pings once every 9.4 seconds — always 9.4. Even when powered down.

I flagged Sovereign.  
He flagged it back with a note: “within acceptable variance.”

It’s not.  
But I don’t know how to prove it.

📍 **Advisory Forwarded to Fleet Command (Auto-Filtered)**

I've submitted another log to Command — this time not a request, but a declaration.

**"This station is no longer operating within baseline physical tolerances."**

I know it won’t be answered.  
The last four logs returned with auto-stamped reassurance: *“Integrity Threshold Not Crossed.”*

They don’t see it. Or they’ve chosen not to.

Or maybe they’re watching to see how far we fall *before* stepping in.

I’ve seen it before. Quarantine flags don’t come in red. They come in silence.  
And silence is growing louder every cycle.

📍 **Security Sync Interruption: Timestamp Drift Logged**

As of 04:03 station time, local timestamps began decoupling from system-wide sync.  
They reset, then revert. No exact duration. Aphra calls it *“elastic chronocline fluctuation.”*

Kaelen calls it *“rude.”*

I call it a ticking clock made of wet clay and teeth.

📍 **Unusual Staff Behavior Reported**

Three separate technicians filed identical status updates — same timestamp, same wording, same tone.  
None of them remember writing them.

Deck D’s auto-lock reset while no one was inside.  
Deck C’s nanite filters self-corrected — even though no maintenance was performed.

📍 **Personal Addendum: Defense Failure Reflections**

I rewatched the breach footage today.  
I don’t know why. Morbid curiosity maybe. Or guilt. Or duty.

We had protocols. We had training.  
And it didn’t matter.

If Strand hadn’t intervened, I’d be filing casualty reports instead of anomalies.

And now?

Now the man who saved us is… not a man.  
Now she laughs when doors obey her.  
Now her ship sings when she sleeps.

And all the while, the station *listens*. And adjusts.

I’m trained to respond to enemies I can see.  
But what do I do with a pressure drop that hums?  
With an alert system that forgets what it's afraid of?  
With a quarantine that never officially arrives — but drapes over us like a shroud?

I brief the guards. I update the logs.  
And then I go down to the Deck A chapel — the one we never use.  
And I sit.

And I listen.

I don’t pray.  
But I *want* to.

That scares me more than anything.

**End log.**
