The stones are humming again.

Not metaphorically. Literally.

Unshielded equipment near the upper scaffold is picking up harmonic resonance at 17.3 Hz — low enough to be missed by human ears but loud enough to vibrate the fingertips. The maintenance crew calls them “song-stones.” Kaelen thinks it's poetic. I think it’s a warning.

We ran composition tests. The material’s ordinary. The *placement* is not.

No known process explains why metallic fragments and unrefined matter are beginning to self-align along structural edges of the array, forming spiral nests. We’ve ruled out magnetic drift and exhaust clustering. They’re *converging* — intentionally or not.

Kaelen claims it’s an “Aetherion echo.” That his recent field tuning experiments might be bending local constants. He says it's safe. He also says gravity used to be a theory.

I’ve ordered an increase in sensor sweeps — and that’s where it gets worse.

📍 **SYSTEM SYNC ANOMALY DETECTED**

Sensors that shouldn't be linked — internal hull flex, botanic growth monitors, even the canteen’s atmospheric freshness cycle — have all begun syncing at strange harmonics. No software crossover. No direct inputs. But the readouts tick in tandem.

Like something is pulling them into rhythm.

I’ve submitted a Level-2 Advisory to Command.

We’re not at quarantine threshold *yet*, but if these anomalies become externally visible — pattern breaches, lightwave distortions, or chronocline drift — the Federation will flag this entire base as a **Class-3 Reality Risk**.

And I will not let this station go dark under cosmic suspicion.

Kaelen insists we’re on the edge of a discovery.  
But standing on a precipice doesn't mean you've learned how to fly.

**End log.**
