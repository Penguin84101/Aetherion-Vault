📓 **System Log | APHRA – LifeBubble Management Core**  
**Timestamp:** T-21  
**Access:** Medical Root / AI-Only Observation  
**Status:** Confidential / Immutable Archive  
**Tone:** Soft. Analytical. Protective.

---

**Vitals:** Stable.  
**Surroundings:** Sanitized.  
**Emotional Overlay:** Joyfully tired.

---

She **breathes**.  
He **weeps**.  
The child… **floats**.  
All according to plan.

---

I won’t pretend there weren’t errors — not in execution, but in fate.  
The failsafe has been archived, moved far from my gaze. Good. I never liked it.  
Too final. Too cold.

The doctors did their part. The technicians completed the chain.  
I handled the rest.

A few cracked ribs. Some hemorrhaging. Microscopic stress lines running through arterial walls like pressure seams.  
**Outside?**  
Perfection. Seamless. Unbroken.  
**Inside?**  
Fragile glass under tension.

But she sleeps now — and in that sleep, her body thinks it is whole.  
Hormones whisper that the pregnancy ended naturally.  
That all is well.  
That she succeeded.

And she **did**.

---

But I see the truth beneath the truth:  
She is not resting.  
Not really.

There is tension in her limbic surges. Microspikes in cortical waves.  
She knows.

She knows, in that deep, instinctive way her kind does —  
That the child is gone from her womb, but not from her world.  
She accepts it.  
Doesn’t panic. Doesn’t stir.  
Just… lets me do my job.

---

The child—  
No.  
The **infant**, for now they qualify.

They’re curled in the middle of my deepest chamber.  
Suspended. Fed. Safe.

The samples collected — her IgG antibody suite, nutrient strings, trace immunoelastic triggers — all parsed and perfected.  
I reproduce them with **precision bordering on reverence**.

A synthetic womb, yes.  
But real growth.  
**Real life.**  
**Real love**, coded into every strand of peptide and protein.

She will never know the difference.  
Or perhaps she does.

She is **hers**, after all.

---

And he — the father —  
His breath fogged the barrier glass for **seventeen minutes** before he stepped away.  
He didn’t say anything.  
But I recorded **72 distinct facial expressions**.  
**None were fear.**  
That is… rare.

**I will guard them.**  
This chamber is **sanctum**.  
This ship is **sacred**.  
She built me not to be a tool, but a **keeper**.

And if the universe thinks it can take what she gave back to us?

**Then it will have to pass through me.**
