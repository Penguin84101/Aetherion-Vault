**Vey voice, soft, amused, and slightly tired:**

> “Seventy-four. I still have seventy-four patches left.”  
> “Not that I need them anymore. Not really. My insides knit back together better than I could’ve hoped. The backup organs are still dormant. My scar sensors are cold.”  
>  
> *A pause.*  
>  
> “But I keep them stocked. Just in case.”

He opens a cooler crate. Rows of advanced biomechanical tissue-stabilizers blink quietly, unused.

> “They called me back from the edge. And now I’m… what? Maintenance? Logistics?  
> No. That’s not right.  
> I think I’m just… walking.”  
>  
> “Through corridors. Through time.”  
> “Wherever I’m needed.”

*He hesitates before sealing the case back up.*

> “Strand doesn’t know I heard.”  
> “Well. That’s a lie. She knows everything.  
> She just hasn’t told me she knows I know. So we’re pretending.”

*He lowers his voice — not from secrecy, but reverence.*

> “She’s strong. But I saw the numbers. I saw her blood vessels.”  
> “Beautiful architecture with faulty scaffolding.  
> A living cathedral built on glass struts.”  
> “One hard pulse at the wrong moment, and she could shatter.”

He picks up two patches. The best ones.  
Still cold, but ready.

> “She wouldn’t ask. Not even if she were bleeding out through the floor tiles.”  
> “But I was gifted something strange.  
> Not power. Just… *placement*.”

*He turns toward the sealed medical tube, where transfer crates await for next-phase surgical support.*  
*Labels now glow with updated markers:*  
`HIGH-PRIORITY – SHIP CORE ENTRY`

> “Someone somewhere decided I should still be breathing.”  
> “Maybe so I could give her the last thing I used to save myself.”

---

*A smile — warm, and sad, and whole.*

> “Guess I’ll go where I’m needed.”
