📓 **Internal Log | Technician Briefing – “When the Humming Stopped”**  
🛠 **Sector:** Core Diagnostics & Auxiliary Systems  
📎 **Compiled by:** Technopath II [Callsign: “Hexnut”]  
🕐 **Timestamp:** T+36 Hours After Psionic Storm

[**BEGIN LOG**]

🛠 **HEXNUT (moderating):**  
“Alright. We’ve all seen the logs. The power dips, the waveform spike. The humming stopped. And the humming *should never stop*.”

💡 **Faye (energy systems):**  
“It wasn’t even a power failure. Everything stayed within tolerance. But it felt like—”

🎛️ **CALI (atmos-mod):**  
“Like the base took a breath in and forgot to exhale.”

🛠 **HEXNUT:**  
“Exactly. The issue wasn’t electrical. It was *resonant*. The harmonic fields tied to the ship’s core — *Strand’s* ship — flickered. Then went flat.”

🧬 **SONDER (biofeedback interface tech):**  
“And they’re only now coming back. Like a singer regaining their pitch. Slowly.”

🎛️ **CALI:**  
“Which implies the system isn’t just technological. It’s aware. Or responsive. Or both.”

🧬 **SONDER:**  
“It’s tied to her. To *them*, actually. We have waveform fingerprints now — Strand, Kaelen, the child. They form a stabilizing triad. When that balance was disrupted—”

🛠 **HEXNUT:**  
“Everything shivered.”

💡 **Faye:**  
“But this wasn’t an attack. That’s the part that scares me. It was joy. Passion.  
Whatever happened between the Emissary and June — it wasn’t hostile.  
To think the whole base got *Rhoed* by June.”

🧬 **SONDER:**  
“Which means—please don’t say that—**which means** the system is vulnerable even to *friendly* anomalies.”

🛠 **HEXNUT (grim):**  
“If a *kiss* can knock this place off balance, what could a scream do?”

*A long silence. Someone shifts in their chair. The overhead light hums — off-key.*

🛠 **HEXNUT (resuming):**  
“We’re going to draft an incident theory. Propose shield modulations. Layered resonance dampeners. And…”  
(*glances at the projected waveform*)  
“…some way to isolate the *emotional harmonics* of core-linked entities during spike events.”

🎛️ **CALI:**  
“You’re not suggesting we put the goddess in a Faraday cage?”

🛠 **HEXNUT:**  
“I’m suggesting we *ask her nicely* first.”

💡 **Faye:**  
“Do you think they could give a *cátedra* on how to screw harmonically using psionics? I suspect it has to do with the hips—”

🎛️ **CALI:**  
“Faye, I will *sedate* you.”

💡 **Faye:**  
“Huh. If I had a credit for every time I heard that, I’d have two credits — which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened *twice*.”

🛠 **HEXNUT:**  
“Tranquilizers are on container G2.”

🎛️ **CALI:**  
“Thanks.”

💡 **Faye:**  
“Hold on—”

📎 **Action Items:**

- Begin design on *Psionic Buffering Shells* for critical systems.  
- Propose a *Linked-Entity Response Index (LERI)* — scalable protocol to estimate risk of emotional surges from core-bonded individuals.  
- Prepare findings for presentation to:  
  - Captain  
  - Security Chief  
  - Sovereign (station AI)  
  - Dr. Kaelen Rho (as Designated Guardian of Core Entity)

🧾 **Closing Note – HEXNUT (personal comment):**

> “We built this base to channel unlimited energy.  
> We didn’t expect emotion to be the strongest current.”  
> “And we definitely didn’t prepare for *love at full output*.”
