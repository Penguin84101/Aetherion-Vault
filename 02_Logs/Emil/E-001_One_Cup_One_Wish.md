I brought Kaelen coffee tonight.

Not synthbrew. Real beans. Grown in old Earth soil — probably the most irresponsible thing in my ration pack.

He was hunched over the console like a man losing chess to a quantum storm.  
Eyes dry. Shoulders tense.

He blinked when I placed the cup beside him. Looked at me like I’d just handed him a map out of hell.

Then...

He smiled.

Just a small smile. But it was real.

> “Thanks,” he said.

I didn’t say anything back. Just nodded and left before the moment could collapse under Kaelen’s usual scowl.

My room was quiet.  
I sat down. My legs ached more than usual.  
The tremors in my fingers were worse.

I palmed the diagnostic chip in my coat pocket. Didn’t need it. I already knew.

The sequence was unraveling faster than predicted.  
The last regenerative patch was holding my organs together like sticky tape on wet paper.

The AI noticed my vitals.

> **MILSPEC-INSTANCE**: “Dr. Vey, you are exhibiting terminal degradation. Shall I notify—”

> “No. Please. Don’t. They’re doing too much already.”

A pause. Then the voice again — gentle, quiet, somewhere between mother and memory.

> “Elephants do this, you know. Wander off when they feel the end coming. Quietly. Alone.”

I chuckled. Then coughed.

Bright red bloomed on my sleeve.

> “I’m more of a giraffe man myself,” I whispered.

I lay back on the cot. Let my breath slow.

The lights dimmed automatically.  
Thanks.

I could feel my heart faltering — stuttering like a worn machine.  
There was no fear. Just the warmth of the coffee still lingering in my hands.

And the faintest scent of pine, though there were no trees on this station.

Then *she* came.

Not through the door. Not as data.

As presence.

A woman — not made of flesh, but of color and symmetry and something deeper than biology.  
Like she had stepped out of music.

She knelt by my cot and looked **into** me.  
Not at. *Into*.

> “Do you fear death?” she asked.

> “No,” I said. “I fear leaving too much undone.”

> “Do you believe you were loved?”

> “Yes. Not loudly, but truly.”

> “Do you have a final wish?”

I thought. Then smiled.

> “No. But I’d like to pass my blessing to the next poor soul. Let them have two.”

She tilted her head. Her laughter was like falling glass chimes.

> “That certainly brings back memories. Very well. Then I will multiply Kaelen’s wish.”

> “You know about his wish?”

> “He made it with no words, but all his heart.”

I exhaled.

Everything around me faded.  
No more pain. No more weight. Just light — and the warmth of a star.

---

And then—

I woke up.

Whole.

No pain. My breath easy. My body... younger. *Restored*.

I was in the same cot. But the light was golden.

Outside, the station was filled with laughter and weeping.  
Crew hugging. Cheering.  
Even Kaelen — tired and grim — was speaking to Strand in a low voice, defeated but no longer angry.

I stepped out.

Someone handed me a drink I didn’t recognize. I tasted it.

Sweet. Cold. Wild.

I didn’t say a word.  
Just smiled.  
And joined the celebration.
