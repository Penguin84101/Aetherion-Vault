📓 **Maintenance Log | “Post-Flush Philosophy”**  
🧼 **Location:** Hallway Outside Restroom #4B, Sector 3  
🕰 **Timestamp:** 04:14:51  
🧍‍♂️ **Personnel:** Emil (Designation: Reborn, Technician, Slightly Sticky Still)  

---

**EMIL** (recording, hands in pockets, eyes adjusting to corridor lighting):

> “Okay. So. First log post-bathroom resurrection.”

(*Clears throat.*)

> “Everything stayed in. Mostly.  
> The patch held. I’d like to thank... nanogel adhesive, duct tape, divine intervention, and a bowl of mystery soup from the kitchen’s emergency cache.”

(*Silence. Then—sigh.*)

> “She’s still alive.”

(*He rubs the back of his neck.*)

> “And I’m still trying to figure out if that’s more terrifying than dying was.”

---

**EMIL (internal, quieter):**

> “They said I patched her with the last good batch of regenerative lattice we had on the station.”  
> “No ceremony. Just... gave it. It’s what I had.”  
> “I didn’t even know she needed it. But... I knew.”

(*Shrugs.*)

> “That's my trick. I show up. When it matters.”

---

(*Small pause.*)

> “No superpowers. No wolf legacy. No spark of godhood. Just... gut feeling.  
> And enough lingering guilt to fill a pressure suit.”

---

**EMIL** (leaning on corridor rail):

> “The paladin was meditating when I came out. Said nothing.  
> Just looked at me. You know the look. That ‘we’re keeping watch for each other now’ look.”  
>  
> “And Kaelen? Still out cold.  
> Poor bastard’s going to wake up with a crick in his neck and a thousand rumors about being... well, *that guy*.”

(*Moment of amused silence.*)

> “I mean, ten hours? Really? With a goddess?”

(*Laughs. Then quiets.*)

> “She’s not a goddess to me.  
> She’s just Strand.”

📎 **Internal AI Tap-In — SOVEREIGN Commentary:**

> *“Reborn technician displays signs of low-level existential processing.  
> No immediate psychological threat.  
> Recommend: strong tea, a seat near a viewport, and one gentle conversation with someone who won’t ask him to explain what he felt.”*

---

**EMIL (final thoughts):**

> “I’ve been dead. I’ve been alive.  
> I’ve been the reason she still breathes.”

> “Now I’m just tired.”

> “But the base hums again. Just slightly.  
> Not the full resonance. But a thread. A whisper.”

> “She’s coming back.  
> One step, one flicker, one hum at a time.”
