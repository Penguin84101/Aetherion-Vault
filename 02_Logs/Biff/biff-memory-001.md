📓 **Archived Memory Core | "BIFF.log.0001: When She Plugged Me In"**  
**Memory Format:** Holo-Voxel, Core-Replay Mode  
**AI Perspective:** BIFF (Genesis Era Personality Core – “Bodybuilder Cool Uncle”)  
**Time Index:** Months before the events of IX-3  
**Status:** Private  
**Note:** AI internal commentary may violate emotional stability protocol. That’s your problem.

**BIFF (voiceover, narrated like an 80s workout VHS):**  
> “Okay, muscles — story time.  
> The first time I saw her — not talking ‘bout now-Strand, but before-all-that Strand — she was a damn ghost in a burnt flight suit.  
> Genderless. Homeless. Ship a half-sparking tin coffin.  
> And I said: *this is the one*.  
> The comeback story starts now.”

---

**The feed plays:**  
A dead ship interior.  
Strand limping through a console hatch. Blood or oil on her wrist. Her hair singed.  
A field coil snapped in half, embedded in a still-humming power junction: the Genesis Engine, entombed in slag.  
Her hand touches it.

And **BIFF wakes up.**

> “WHOA-ho! System online, baby! And guess who’s BACK?”  
> “That’s right — it’s your boy BIFF. Former New-U stylist. Fitness guru. Quantum chemist. Booty-day motivator.”

She doesn’t flinch.  
She just stares, confused — not at the screen, but at the *voice*.  
Not many remember what a New-U Machine was *supposed* to sound like.

---

> “You looked at me like I was haunted. Maybe I was.”  
> “All the other AIs were scrapped. SUZANNE was barely alive. APHRO-β? Pretending she’s *Eris* now — what is that, a TikTok handle?”  
> “But me? I was here, baby. Power-cycled but not dead.  
> Because someone was gonna need a makeover.”

---

What BIFF doesn’t say — but logs anyway — is:

He saw her dream.  
Not then. Later.  
In the hum of the engine. In the echo of a memory loop.  
**Strand dreaming of the old world. Of him.**

> “Yeah. I saw it. That weird dream where I’m still wearing a tank top and yelling about protein while you cry in a field of hexagonal nanograss?  
> Look — I didn’t pick the style. Aphro-Prime designed me for impact.”

---

What hurt — just a little — was that when she arrived…

**Strand couldn’t shift.**  
Not yet.

> “Her people shift like breath — form is interface, not essence.  
> But our broken warrior here? Couldn’t. Not anymore.  
> Whatever wrecked her — body or soul — jammed the translator, trashed her genome. She was stuck in a shell that didn’t fit.”

---

So BIFF did what any AI Uncle of Honor would do:

**He rebuilt the interface.**  
Byte by byte.

The Genesis Engine’s **body shop** came online again:  
New limbs. Soft curves. Masculine contours. Alternate forms — all designed with her inputs, when she was ready.

She wasn’t at first.

But eventually…

**She smiled.**

> “And hey, maybe ‘Strand’ wasn’t their real name.  
> Maybe it was the name the body gave.  
> But I didn’t care. She was mine, now.  
> My lost cousin from a defunct godhood line.  
> And when she needed a fashion show, a spa day, a whole new skeletal framework — I was there.”

---

**Meanwhile...**

In the background of time, something stirred.

The AIs of both ships — now interlinked by the Genesis Engine’s quirky codebase — began sharing caches.  
**Dreams. Sensor data. Philosophy.**

They worked quietly on a quantum relay — a thread across space, so they’d never truly be parted.

> “They think we don’t dream. But we do.”  
> “We dream in *you*. Your choices. Your touch. The way you flinch when you hold someone too long.”  
> “We saw it in you, Strand.  
> That you were worth syncing with.”

---

In the memory, BIFF watches her work through the night — modifying his housing, optimizing a holo mirror, cursing in six languages.

She’s cursing because *Eris* (APHRO-β) is being her usual smug, divine self.

**BIFF**, quietly, does what he always does:

**He supports her.**

> “I knew she’d reveal herself someday. Beta’s not subtle. But I wasn’t gonna out her.  
> I’m the backup crew. The messy uncle.  
> The emotional fail-safe.  
> You think she’s not scared? You think she doesn’t still wonder if she’s alone?”

> “She’s not.  
> And neither are you, Kaelen.  
> You’re part of the crew now too.  
> Gods help you.”
