I keep thinking I should feel stranger than I do.

When I woke up after the incident — still me, but not — the first emotion wasn't fear.

It was confusion.  
Then curiosity.  
Then... something like calm.

I looked in the mirror. Blinked.

It was still my face. Just... *reshaped*.  
Softer. Longer. The jawline had changed. My eyelashes looked longer.  
My body — lighter in some places, heavier in others.

We were told this was temporary.  
But even so, the change felt overwhelming.

I should’ve panicked.  
But I didn’t.

This change... it feels **natural**.

---

The others laughed. Tried on names.  
Someone — I don’t know who — called me **Faye**.

I laughed. Then I said it out loud.  
**Faye.**  
It fit.

I didn’t *mean* to keep it.  
But I haven’t put it down since.

---

The clothes didn’t help — we looked ridiculous.  
I wrapped a synthweave lab coat like a toga. Someone tied a scarf on my head.

But even like that, I felt... pretty.  
Really pretty.

And I noticed **Cam** looking at me.  

Not weirdly.  
Not nervously.  
Just... differently.

---

We’ve known each other since orientation.  
Used to share trays in the cafeteria. Swear over exam rubrics.

But now?

He looked at me like I was **something worth leaning toward**.

I don’t remember who spoke first.  
Maybe it was me. Maybe him.

One of us touched the other’s arm.  
One of us smiled.

We slipped out quietly during Dr. Rho’s speech.  
Didn’t say what we were doing.  
We didn’t have to.

---

Cam's room was small. Dark. Warm.
The door slid shut behind us.

He touched my face like he was asking a question.
I didn’t answer.

I just leaned in.

---

His hands were warm.  
So were mine.  
Clothes fell away, piece by piece — unnoticed. Unneeded.

We sat on the bed.  
Breathing slowed. Skin on skin.

We talked about protection for a second.  
Like it was a checklist item on a lab exam.

Then dismissed it.

> "The nanites will pass."  
> "This isn’t real."  
> "We’ll go back."

But in that moment?

I didn’t want to go back.  
I wanted him to kiss me like I mattered.

Like **Faye** mattered.

He leaned in — just inches away.  
His eyes were wide.  
Mine were closed.

---

Then—  
**SLAM.**

A metallic shriek.  
A hydraulic hiss.  
A boot kicked the door open like the sun had come to die.

**Dr. Kaelen Rho.**  
Flared coat. Eyes on fire. Voice like thunder punched through vacuum.

> “EXPLAIN. YOURSELVES.”

I screamed.  
Cam fell backward.  
The bed nearly flipped.

He saw everything.  
I *know* he saw enough.

---

There’s a disciplinary review tomorrow.  
I might lose lab access. Maybe worse.

But when I think about that kiss we didn’t quite finish...

...I still don’t regret going.

**End log.**
