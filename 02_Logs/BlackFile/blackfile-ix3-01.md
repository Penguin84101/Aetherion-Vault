It flared again.

**IX-3.**

That twisted blot of theoretical purity, locked down like a grave site — a chaos-saturated anomaly spinning in a region no one sane claims.

We sealed it.  
We said it was broken.  
We made the reports ugly enough no one would read past the first line.

> Dimensional rupture.  
> Reality flux.  
> Organic waveform destabilization.

Good enough.  
Nobody argues when the radiation chart draws a spiral and the base starts humming in minor keys.

---

**And yet.**

It’s reporting again.

Not a distress call.  
Not a beacon.  
**Provisions requested. Reports filed. Positive morale index.**

They’re using words like:

> "Stability."  
> "Breakthrough."  
> "Life-positive harmonic distortion signature."

I call bullshit.

---

The last confirmed telemetry showed a **pregnancy signal spike so aggressive the waveform ate the encryption header.**

Their central AI was believed degraded — barely active during the initial lockdown.

Now?

That bloated master AI — dormant during seven regional emergencies — **lights up like a warship’s eyes** and says:

> “I require reconnaissance.”

Like a dog asking to go for a walk.

And we let it.

Because what else do you do when the digital dead ask for sunlight?

---

**The Wolf returned.**

Slipped past the relay gate like **smoke with teeth.**  
Clutching something.

> Data?  
> DNA?  
> A confession?

Whatever it found — it didn’t log it where I could see.  
Just spat out static. Like a memory resisting interpretation.

---

**The sector's supposed to be dead.**

But instead of ash, I see:

> • New gravitational ripples  
> • Quantum emotion distortion  
> • Aphrodite-signature logic echoes

I haven’t seen *TeleScriptOS* syntax in over a thousand cycles.  
That protocol **burned** when the original mirror gates cracked.

And now it **breathes again?**

---

**Fine.**

Let’s try an old trick.

I authorized the emissary.

They were stalled, of course — paperwork, security, genetics, disbelief.

But bureaucracy’s for people who don’t have **hands like mine.**

With a twitch of thought, the locks fell away.

---

Let the emissary go.  
Let them see.  
Let them step onto the base and come back with an answer.

Because if that **divine data hole** is purring again, and if **wolves** are bringing back gifts…

> I want to know **who fed it.**
