…I shouldn’t be thinking about it again.  
But the ship keeps replaying the sensory echo.  
Like it wants me to remember every second in perfect clarity.

Maybe I want that too.

I teased him.  
For days. Weeks, really.  
Flirting just past the line.  
Pressing close. Dropping hints folded in myth and metaphor — the kind that makes a man wonder whether he’s aroused or undergoing philosophical enlightenment.

And Kaelen… gods.

He endured it. Studied it.  
Measured my provocations like equations to be solved.

Until he didn’t.

He kissed me like it was the first thing he ever truly wanted.  
Not as a prize. Not out of conquest.  
As if he was finally allowed to feel — and chose to feel *me*.

He pinned me against the chamber rail at first. Gently.  
Hands on my waist like I was an unstable variable.

But I saw the way his jaw clenched.  
The way his breath caught.  
So I arched. Dared him.

He moved then.

Pressed me down onto that cot with reverence like a burn.  
And when he entered me — slow, centered, impossibly careful — I forgot my name.

Kaelen Rho is a man who makes sense of stars, but that night…

He *unmade* me.

He learned my rhythm like code.  
Changed pace just as I begged. Shifted angle as I shattered — again and again — until my voice cracked, raw from release.

I screamed. Into his shoulder. Into the ship.

And even when the cot cracked beneath us, moaning in surrender — he didn’t stop.

Not until I was trembling. Slick with sweat.  
Hips twitching at every touch.  
Not until my knees gave out.  
Not until we were *both* ruined.

Even now, lying still, my body remembers.  
My hips ache — deliciously.  
That slow, pulsing heat hasn’t faded.

Neither has the truth of it:  
I wasn’t just desired.  
I was *seen*.

Not as legend. Not as alien.

As **Strand**.

The Genesis Engine has catalogued it, no doubt.  
The hormonal imprint alone probably rewrote a protocol tree.  
But I don’t care.

I can still feel the weight of his body.  
The tremble in his breath.  
The laughter we shared after — between kisses and splintered furniture.

I may have teased him too much.

But gods, was it worth it.
