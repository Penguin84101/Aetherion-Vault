> “If you're listening to this...  
> I don’t know what that means.  
> I don’t believe in last words, so let’s not call it that.”

> “I’ve been many things.  
> A warrior. A weapon.  
> A test subject. A ship thief. A failed goddess.”

> “I’ve seen planets sing themselves to death and people survive anyway.”

> “I never thought I'd be scared of something so small.”

> “It’s funny. I’ve held together through wounds, betrayals, vacuum, war.  
> But now I carry a thing that isn’t war. That isn't death.  
> And that’s the thing that might break me.”

> “I said I wasn’t built for this.”  
> “But that’s not true.”  
> “I was rebuilt for this. Whether I knew it or not.”

> “If I don’t wake up... don’t mourn me like a martyr.  
> Don’t put me in a textbook.  
> Just make sure she knows I fought for her.  
> Not out of duty.  
> Out of choice.”

> “And if I do wake up...  
> Don’t let me pick up a sword too soon.”  
> “I’m terrible at resting.”
