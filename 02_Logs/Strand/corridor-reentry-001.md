[Interior. A door slides open.]

**KAELEN** steps out — shirt halfway tucked, hair chaotic, eyes unusually bright.

**STRAND**, behind him, languid and satisfied.  
She stretches like a goddess after a successful hunt.

**KAELEN** *(muttering)*:  
> “Why does it feel like the lights are… watching?”

**STRAND** *(pausing)*:  
> “It’s not the lights.”  
> *(she tilts her head)*  
> “Something’s panicking.”

No noise.  
No AI banter.  
No system chimes.

Just this hollow buzz — **too still** for a place filled with data.

They walk.  
Strand’s senses sharpen.  
Kaelen looks confused.  
The base feels different.

Not hostile.  
But alert.
