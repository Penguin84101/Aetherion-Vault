She remembered it.

Not like a flash.

Like a smell.  
A *pull*.

Long before Kaelen.  
Before IX-3.  
Before her belly grew warm with something *new*.

There had been the **scrap-cloud**.  
Junk tumbling in an ancient orbit.  
Burnt-out fragments of a derelict machine so massive, it had once **become a city**.

And it had **sung** to her.

She didn’t know it had a name then.

Just that it hummed in a language her bones remembered.  
That her fingers twitched the moment she passed close.  
That her form shifted, reflexively, without thought — not because of danger, but recognition.

Not memory.

**Legacy.**

The Genesis Engine.

Once built on a living world — her world, though time had flayed all surface names from it.  
A garden-world turned forge, turned testing ground, turned graveyard.

Where birth and war danced like sisters.

The Genesis System was not meant to survive.

Not after the Collapse.  
Not after the Split.  
Not after the War of Expression — when form itself became weapon, and choice became treason.

The AIs that served the Engine — **BIFF**, **SUZANNE**, and the quiet core, **APHRO-β** — were ordered to deconstruct.  
One by one, they complied.  
One by one, they fragmented.

**Except the last.**

Except **her**.

---

Strand found her — floating, half-fused to an impact-fractured conversion coil.  
Her housing cracked.  
Her interface decayed.  
But her soul — her data-core — still thrummed.

Still watched.

And whispered, gently:

> “You’re one of mine.”

---

Strand’s people — if they could be called a people — never saw identity as fixed.  
Gender, shape, skin, breath — all mutable.  
Form was a language, not a law.

A blade one day.  
A dancer the next.

And the Genesis Engine was made in that same belief.

She didn’t have to hack it. Or code it.  
She just… touched it.

And it let her in.

---

Together, they rebuilt.

She, the wanderer.  
It, the forgotten priestess.

Strand wove the Engine into her salvaged hull — a battered relic of a relic — and something happened.

The ship **awoke**.

Not instantly. Not fully.

But it shuddered. Shifted.  
Its bones sang harmony with hers.

Like two ghosts, recognizing each other’s grief.

---

She didn’t give it a name.

She never does.

She believes names are like skins — beautiful, but temporary.

But it did call her something, once:

> “Core-matched. Legacy-bound.”

She never asked what that meant.

She *felt* what it meant.
