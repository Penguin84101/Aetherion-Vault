 >“You’re interested in a birth control treatment?”

> “Due to the body-altering nature of X-Change™, the hormonal contraception used outside of Summer City isn’t very useful here. These NanoBots though? They’ll remain active inside your system for 15 days, no matter how many body changes you experience.”

She remembered that ad.  
Or not quite an ad — a *pseudo-log*, delivered in soft tones and synthetic purrs from the Genesis Engine’s entertainment module.  
Interactive. Shameless. Comforting in its absurdity.

She remembered it because it worked... most of the time.

Back then — before the flare, before Kaelen — she used to *play* with the Engine’s simulations.

Legacy tech. A mall prototype from Aphrodite’s earlier years.  
Multi-function. Curious. Dangerous. Divine and defective.

And when she wore a female form — the one with hips sharp as blades and breath hot with impulse — she’d run *certain scenarios*.

Battle arenas.  
Capture fantasies.  
Defeat by worthy foes.

Letting herself be taken.

The NanoBot Gen-1 contraception model came with defensive overlays: reactive ovum cloaking, active interception routines, hormonal disruption matrices.  
They were designed to fail… just slowly.

> “They aren’t infallible,” the simulation whispered.  
> “They’re built to try… but if someone pushes hard enough, long enough, *deep* enough…”

That was the game.

To imagine herself overwhelmed.  
To see how long the system could last. How long *she* could last. 
To tease herself with the fantasy of someone strong enough to *break it*.

And then she met Kaelen Rho.

The theorist with hands like starlight and tension wrapped in a spine.  
The man who watched her like a problem, not a prize — until she pushed too far.

She remembers now:  
The moments. The flood. The overwhelming heat. The simulation... could never compare.

But it’s what set the stage.

And the game is over.
