She stood naked under the scanner.

Hips still sore.  
Thighs still trembling.  
Kaelen’s taste still in her mouth.

Her breath hitched as the light flickered.

**Fertilization: Confirmed.**  
**Physiology Lock: Gestation In Progress.**

The warning came in a soft, clinical tone — almost tender.

> “Form Preservation Active. Internal restructuring restricted for safety.”

Her body was now fixed.  
This version — the one not meant to give birth — was pregnant.

And it would kill her.

If she stayed like this...  
It would *end* her.

---

She placed a hand over her belly.  
Still flat. Still strong.  
But no longer hers alone.

There was a rhythm under her ribs now.  
Kaelen’s rhythm.

She should’ve been afraid.

Instead, her knees buckled again — not from weakness, but from memory.  
From the sound of his breath, his voice, the way he kissed her just as she surrendered.

The Genesis Engine *knew*.  
It *always knows*.

A hum rolled through the walls.  
The scanner flared.  

And schematics unspooled across the display:

> **LifeBubble: UTERINE DETACHMENT-ASSISTED GESTATIONAL MODULE**  
> **STATUS: READY FOR FABRICATION**

Her breath caught. She touched the console.

She didn’t speak. Didn’t cry.  
Not at first.

But tears came — not from pain.  
Not from fear.

From *hope*.

---

She dressed.  
Tied back her hair.  
And walked — slow, steady — toward the medical wing.

Toward a future.  
Toward safety.  
Toward *both* of them.
