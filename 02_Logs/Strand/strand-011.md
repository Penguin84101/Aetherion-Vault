📓 **STRAND – Reflection Log | “The Core Remembers Me”**  
**Location:** Her Ship’s Primary Chamber – Non-Euclidean Core Deck  
**Timestamp:** T–24 Hours *(17 minutes before sedation)*  
**Tone:** Quiet awe. Gratitude. Bone-deep weariness and grace.

[**Visual:** A vast hall folding into itself like starlight poured into an origami blossom. At its center, the broken heart of the ship — still inert. A single light pulses faintly inside.]

**Strand walks slowly**, wrapped in a soft diagnostic robe.  
Not her armor. Not her leathers. Just cloth. Just skin.

> “It was supposed to be scrap.”  
>  
> “The Engine. The AIs. Me.”  
>  
> “We were all thrown out of something sacred. Burnt, salvaged, found.”

[She passes beneath a suspended shell: her personal **LifeBubble**, ready to receive the child.]

> “And yet... they all came here.”  
>  
> “The builders. The thinkers. The fools.  
> The quiet ones who kept building even when they didn’t know why.”  
>  
> “And Kaelen.  
> The man who was supposed to be logic.  
> Who became something... tender and terrible.”  
>  
> “I shall put my womb here.  
> In this broken heart.”

[She touches the capsule — the shell — her **LifeBubble**.  
She syncs with it. **Aphra**, the AI inside, nods in the virtual plane in response. Solemn. Decided. So is she.]

> “Because if I come back — if I wake —  
> I want her born where I was remade.”

[She touches the wall now. The ship hums — not alive, but **listening**.]

> “You remember me, don’t you?”  
>  
> “I pulled you from death.  
> Now you’re holding us.  
> I don’t know what that makes you.”  
>  
> “But thank you.”

[**Silence.** She breathes in.]

> “Let this be the place where something new starts.”
