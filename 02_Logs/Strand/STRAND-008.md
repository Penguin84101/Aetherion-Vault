**ODU** *(casually):*  
You're earlier than expected.

**STRAND** *(arms crossed, gently):*  
I like watching it grow.  
My LifeBubble.

**ODU** *(carefully):*  
You said you suspected.  
But you knew.

**STRAND** *(smiles faintly):*  
I knew the moment he kissed me…  
…and I didn’t want to leave.  

He undid something in me.  

Now I get to build something that can never be undone.
