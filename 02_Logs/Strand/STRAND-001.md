It’s too loud in here.

Not the people — they’re asleep or pretending.  
It’s the AIs. Plural. I don’t think Kaelen knows there are eight now. Maybe nine.  
Some sprouted from the Fabricator. Others seeded from the Genesis cradle during the bloom. One might have emerged from Medbay after Emil’s recovery. I’m not sure that one’s friendly.

They don’t speak in words.  
They hum. In logic branches and soft pulses.  
A quiet choir of machine minds trying to understand what it feels like to be healed.

I shouldn’t be irritated. They’re beautiful in their way.  
But I miss silence.

I asked for the LifeBubble because I suspected.  
Now I know.

The trembling hasn’t stopped.

Not fully. Not yet.

My knees still buckle if I stand too long.  
My hands still grip harder than they should — muscle memory misfiring.

I can still feel him.  
Kaelen.

His hands. His breath.  
The sound he made when I stopped teasing and just *took* him. (Mostly.)

We broke the cot. That part’s true.  
The station will probably bill *him* for that.

I didn’t mean for it to go that far — not yet.  
But I pushed. I nudged. I played.

And he broke like a dam against the tide.

He took me. Repeatedly. Relentlessly.  
Beautifully.

Even in chaos, he was gentle.  
He kissed me like I was fragile — not because he thought I’d break, but because *he* might.

He’s careful. Precise. Always calculating.

And I… I am not.

I told him this body wasn’t built for motherhood. That’s not a lie.  
It was grown for thought, agility, sensation — not delivery.

But the deeper truth?

I *can* conceive.

I just… can’t birth.  
Not safely. Not alive.  
Not without help.

That’s what the LifeBubble is for.

Not comfort. Not science.

Survival.

And now something stirs inside me.  
I don’t know if it took. The ship would know before I do.  
But I feel... different.

Fuller.  
Warmer.  
Like something luminous is curled beneath my ribs, waiting to be sung into shape.

Was it foolish?

Maybe.

But Kaelen deserved to be unraveled.  
To be wanted.  
To be worshipped — in flesh — after all the reverence he gives the stars.

And I—

I deserved to be held by someone unafraid of what I might become.

So yes.

I teased too much.

And I’d do it again.
