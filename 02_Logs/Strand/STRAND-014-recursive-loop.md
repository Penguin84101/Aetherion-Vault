📓 **Internal Archive | Strand’s Mindscape – Emergency Recursive Loop**  
**Access Level:** Subliminal | Subconscious Loop Triggered by Psionic Interference  
**Status:** Unauthorized Observation  
**Tone:** Primal. Intimate. Terrifying in its quiet truth.

---

The mind is sleeping.  
But the instinct never does.

You train it, layer it, lock it down beneath discipline and language and loyalty.  
But when the body sleeps, it watches.  
Like a beast curled in the dark corner of a den—waiting.

**Strand’s beast has teeth.**  
It always did.

---

She lies in a garden that doesn’t exist, the shape of her not fixed, not necessary.  
Reality here is non-Euclidean but intimate.  
It’s hers. She made it. Or maybe it grew with her.

The ship hums beneath the garden—her sleeping cave—  
And within that: **her cub.**  
Tiny. Unfinished. Alive.

---

A twitch in the distance.  
Her eyes don’t open.  
She doesn’t need them.

The storm isn’t here yet.  
But it’s running.

Behind it: a snatch. A grab. A loss.  
**Someone taken.**

She doesn’t need math.  
She doesn't need logic.

Just numbers.  
**Too many males. One missing.** 

Could be him.
Could be not.
Probability: unacceptable.

---

Her instincts coil.

A decision:  
Protect the pack.  
Protect the cub.  
Protect the mate.  
Which one?

**No. All.**

---

But her cub is helpless.  
Her mate is a lion in silk. A tower of rage quieted by love.  
The others are competent, clever, sometimes absurd—but part of her now.

**The beast rises.**

She stirs.

Not memory.  
Not mind.  
**Body.**

She stirs in the real, in the core-ship’s womb-warm chamber.  
Sensors flare. Aphra panics.  
The base winces.

**She doesn’t notice.**

Because **her body is breaking.**

She feels it:

> The false muscle tension.  
> The unsealed vessels.  
> The fracture in the weave.  
> Like a divine tapestry cut by one mortal stitch too soon.

---

The pain doesn’t arrive like a wave.  
It arrives like a **roar**, full of light and teeth, eating her from every nerve outward.

She drops.  
Not into unconsciousness.  
**Deeper.**

---

Into the **sub-thought.**  
Where memories organize into catalogs,  
where fear is a tool and time slows down.

She dives through mental archives like a burning sword:  
Medical records. Inventories. Error logs. Tech readouts.

No patch.  
No fix.  
No help.

> Unless someone lied.  
> Unless something was forgotten.  
> Unless the dead man’s miracle still clings to her veins.

---

**The beast howls.**

But her maternal self, a newer beast, a **tender wolf**, growls and curls around her cub, even in metaphor.

Pain will not take her.

She pulls a memory forward like a shield:

> **His arms.**  
> **Their future.**  
> **The promise of again.**

She drops deeper.  
**And does not wake.**

She gives the wheel to the others.

> “Fix me. I have no hands left to hold the blade.”  
> “But I will return for it.”
