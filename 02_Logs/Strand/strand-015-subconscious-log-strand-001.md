There is no time here.  

Only the forest — endless, gently humming, golden shadows leaking through leaves that remember too much.  

Two identical creatures meet at the clearing.  
They never open their eyes — they don’t need to.  
They know the other is there, like memory meeting its echo.  

They don’t speak.  

They run.  
Straight for the cliff.  

The golden demon once whispered to the trees.  
Its words still dance between branches like pollen.  

> **“Jump.”**  

So they do.  
Simultaneous.  
Effortless.  
Obedient.  

One becomes wind, scattering upward in freedom.  
The other burns, crashing, screaming, unraveling.  
And the demon laughs from a memory that should’ve died long ago.  

---  

A nameless beast lies below, basking in a sun that doesn’t burn.  
No eyes. No ears. But it watches.  

It was caught here.  
How long ago?  
A lifetime?  
An hour?  
A second?  
A moment?  

Time doesn’t matter.  
Only the treasure in front of it does — a glowing sphere, humming with emotion.  
It smells like home. And pines.  

The sphere begins to pulse.  
Not light. Not sound.  
But **truth**.

The beast, still silent, opens something deeper than eyes.  

The scent changes:  
Sweat.  
Chlorine.  
Milk.  
Medicine.  

Mate.  
Cub.  
Pack.  

It remembers.  

It isn’t just a beast.  
It is a **strand**, woven into something larger.  
Not the strongest thread. But a **necessary** one.  

It steps forward — a creature made of muscle and myth — and **jumps**.  
Into the light.  

---  

_In the medical wing, a heartbeat flickers once.  
Then twice.  
Then stabilizes._  

The hum does not return yet.  
But **something has begun.**
