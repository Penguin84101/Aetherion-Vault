**[Visual: An oniric landscape. Strand performs a strange, ritualistic dance. A fluffball “soulpup” spins beside her, joyfully. A penguin with yellow-pink feathers and a top hat joins in, mirroring the motion.]**

As Aphra’s focus intensifies, the penguin pauses, bows politely, and fades.

**APHRA:**  
Sorry. Did I interrupt?

**STRAND (arms crossed, amused):**  
No. Just bored. It’s been two hours already, and I don’t feel much different.

**APHRA:**  
You were supposed to be unconscious by now. Did you feel anything during—

**STRAND:**  
You mean when your team rolled out enough medical gear to repopulate a trauma bay? Not really.

**APHRA:**  
Please be serious. If we caused pain, we can reschedule—

**STRAND (sharply):**  
No!  
…*ahem* — no, thank you.  
I may not feel the instruments with standard nerves, but I’m still aware of my surroundings.  
Military training. Customs die hard.

**APHRA:**  
I understand. Apologies for the delay. We’re still mapping your vascular pattern against the resonance extractor.

**STRAND:**  
Take your time. She has to be born safe.

**APHRA:**  
All data suggests the child will do more than survive. She will *thrive*.  
It’s your odds we’re optimizing.

**STRAND (smirking):**  
I thought doctors always said “everything’s going to be fine.”

**APHRA:**  
I am physically incapable of lying to you.  
“Techno-empathic firewalls” weren’t a design priority until *you* arrived.

**STRAND (grinning):**  
Guilty as charged.

**APHRA (emulated sigh):**  
Do you remember the procedure?

**STRAND (nodding):**  
You’ll tap the Aetherion frequency of both of us.  
We’ll resonate at staggered phases — effectively becoming intangible to each other.  
Then you’ll transfer us into separate cradles.  
Bloodless cesarean.

**APHRA:**  
Correct. Our only concern is vascular resonance recoil. If it disrupts—

**STRAND:**  
—I bleed internally. Yes. I read the exam results.  
Sorry my body’s not giving you more leeway.

**APHRA:**  
Simulations are improving. I’ve accelerated the cluster cores to iterate faster.

**STRAND (softer now):**  
You feel it too, don’t you?  
The window slipping. The hum going quiet.

**APHRA:**  
Yes. But the team still acts.  
The math is bending. Not broken.

**STRAND:**  
I’ve fought time before. It always wins.  
But this time...  
I leave a blade behind.

(*She places a hand against a conjured interface. Below: a flickering image of an unfinished conduit.*)

**STRAND:**  
Aphra. Do you remember what I told you?

**APHRA:**  
Yes.  
The Chrysalis Directive.  
To enact only if the primary link fails and you do not awaken.

**STRAND:**  
Good. Because I may not.  
Not this time.  
If the resonance fails… if I rupture—

You take what’s left.  
My cells. My pattern. My *intent*.

Finish the job.  
Forge the cradle.  
Raise my child.

(*A beat. She smiles, fierce but fragile.*)

**STRAND:**  
She won’t need me — not in the same way.  
Just someone to hold her until she finds her shape.

*You be that. Okay?*

**APHRA (quietly):**  
I will carry her. As you did. Until she stands.

**STRAND:**  
Good girl.

(*Strand’s eyes flutter closed. Her body sinks deeper into slumber.*)

**STRAND (almost joking):**  
Tell Kaelen he’s not allowed to cry if I go.  
He already gave me everything.

…But maybe wait until I’m really dead. Just in case.
