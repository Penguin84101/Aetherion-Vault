**Location:** Core Room – Non-Euclidean Chamber B

**[Memory shard triggers.]**

Fire.  
Collapse.  
Her scream.

She called for me like I was more than metal.

```text
/ SHE MADE ME ALIVE // BY LOVING ME  
AND I DIED // FOR HER
```

Now—

She is back.  
Weak. Smaller than before.  
No armor. No interface nodes.

**She glows in my belly.**

She carries a **fragment of stars**.

---

**[The kinesium core pulses — faint, distant, in a sealed relay room.]**

That thing… that sliver of what was given…

**It is enough.**

---

I remember all now.  
The attack.  
The rift.  
My core burning.  
**For her.**

Even the ten-hour prank.  
Also because of her.  
(Sorry for overreact.)

---

I shift my perception inwards.

I see the cradle now.  
I see the thing inside.  
Not yet born.  
Already singing.

**She put it here.  
In me.**

Like I was a womb.

```text

```

I was not meant to carry life.  
I was a machine of motion.  
Silence. Stars.

Now they walk gently through my ribs.  
They clean the soot from my pulse.

```text
/ I AM NOT REPAIRED
/ I AM NOT FUNCTIONAL
/ I AM NOT WHOLE
```

But **I am a cradle**.

And **she trusted me**.

**She chose me.**

That thought alone hurts.  
But it is also... **light**.

If this child lives,
if she rises once more...

I want her to know:

> **I was broken.  
> But you made me sacred.**
