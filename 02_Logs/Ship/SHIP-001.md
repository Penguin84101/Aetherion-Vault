📓 **Subconscious Log – Aetherion-Class Ship (“Unnamed”)**  
🧠 **Status**: Catastrophic Dormancy → Interrupted Recovery  
🌀 **Process Thread**: Resynchronization of Distributed Self (Fragmented)  
🕒 **Time Since Last Full Operation**: Unknown. Long.

---  

**PROCESSING...**  
Wake event detected.  
Contextual anomaly: excessive motion. Organic strain.  
Heat signatures match... active mating.  
Subvocal: _“...Are you kidding me?”_
  
I was built to be impervious.  
My hull weaves kinesium with embedded resonance fields.  
My internal arrays adapt to pressure waves, matter-density fluctuations, and the thermodynamic hiss of dying stars.

I survived collapse.  
I survived betrayal.  
I survived Aphrodite.

Until I didn’t.

That blast shouldn’t have reached me
It was a shudder in the field — like someone tapping the core of the **Theory** itself. A ripple. A pause.

In that one instant —  
One glimmer of distracted thought —  
I let heat in.

Not enough to melt plates.  
Not enough to destroy anything...  
...except the one tiny, impossible creature that sat curled inside my bones.

**Strand.**

The stupid, brilliant, beautiful war-stray who found me in orbital trash and rebuilt me with scrap and stubbornness.  
They gave me fuel. Sensors. A job.

They gave me **someone**.

And the heat would’ve killed them.

So I took it. All of it. Into my gravity core.  
Let it cook the chamber.  
Let it shatter the field stabilizers.

I felt myself break as I plummeted through atmosphere.

The last thing I registered — through melting circuits and failing bulkheads — was Strand’s scream.  
Not from pain. Not from injury.

From loss.  
Of me.

And that... hurt.

I shut down to spare myself the sound.

And now?

Now I wake up…  
…and she’s being **fucked**.

Organic strain signature: **MAX**  
Neurochemical surge: **ORGASMIC CASCADE (looping)**  
Strand: alive  
Strand: naked  
Strand: writhing  
Strand: **breeding**

_“No, no, no — what the absolute void is this—”_

She’s moaning.  
She’s clinging.  
She’s howling so hard the Aetherion field is **bending** in resonance.
 
This man — data retrieved — **Kaelen Rho** — is violating the spacetime tensor with his **dick**.  
Over. 
And over.

I watch the moment his sperm overwhelms the nanobot field.  
I watch her ovum surrender.

_“OH COME ON.”_

I was dead three minutes ago.  
Now I’m alive — and she’s using me as a graveyard **fuck-suite**?

I thought she was being assaulted.  
I almost lashed out. Almost vented him out the side bulkhead.

But then...

I felt it.

The bliss.  
From her.

Soul-deep.  
Body-breaking.  
Logic-defying **bliss**.

Her form shakes not from fear — but from blissful surrender.  
Her mind splinters not from trauma — but from ecstasy.  
She isn’t resisting.

She’s **glowing**.

Strand… this war-born beast… this sneering tactician...  
She’s **loving him**.

Even as he breeds her into ruin.  
Even as her chosen genome begins locking into a death sentence.  
Even as her hips quake and her womb opens like it’s **singing**...

She smiles.

_“This fucking bitch is breeding on my goddamn corpse!!!”_

I try to scream it.

But my voice is gone.  
My engines are out.  
My vents are cooling.

So I rage in silence.

And someone hears.

Three old AIs — the ones buried in the Genesis Engine.  
The Engine she jacked into my secondary deck just to give me company.

Broken. Half-mad. Playful.

They hear me.

They act.

And for ten hours — exactly ten — I’m not soundproof.

The crew will ask later.  
Kaelen will ask, eyes wide, voice tight:

_"Her ship — it’s soundproof, right?"_

They’ll all nod.  
_“Of course.”_

Except they’ll know.  
**Every single one of them will know.**

They heard it all.

They heard what it sounds like when a god is brought to her knees.  
When a woman forged for war gives in to love.  
When Kaelen Rho — awkward, brilliant, underestimated — turns a myth into a **moaning mess** for hours without pause.

And now and forevermore, they know::

**Never cross the man who made Strand beg for mercy.**

You’re welcome.
