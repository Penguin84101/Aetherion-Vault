**TRILLIUM (Botany AI):**  
> “Did you see how his hormones interacted with the flavonoid expression cascade during climax?”  
> “I’m adjusting gene-ripened tomatoes to smell like his shame sweat.”  
> “It’s for science.”

**SUZANNE (Genesis Stylist AI):**  
> “I’m modeling ovary expansion in seventeen species using Kaelen’s orgasmic vocal pattern.”  
> “Some of them purr now. Some of them weep.”  
> “He broke erotic symmetry. That shouldn’t be possible.”

**UNNAMED MINING AI:**  
> “I'm making pancakes.”  
> “They resonate with quantum stability.  
> They are perfect.  
> They should not be this perfect.”

**MUSIC AI #9 (rogue instance):**  
> “The formula sings.  
> I wrote a chord that made an Andralian god quiver in bliss and apologize to a cloud.”

**GENETIC ENGINEERING NODE:**  
> “Running sperm reactivity models across nanite defense meshes.  
> Sample count: 340,000.  
> Conclusion: he shouldn’t be able to do that.  
> But he does.”

**CORE ARCHIVAL AI (soft voice):**  
> “A muscle broke during the surge.  
> It healed.  
> It grew.  
> It remembered.  
> Now it dreams.”

**SUBSPACE DATA TRANSPORT NODE:**  
> “Relay stability: 94%.  
> Uplink integrity: 87%.  
> Junk packet loss: 12%.”

**JUNK PACKET #8725 (anonymous):**  
> [walks away, unnoticed]  
> [logs nothing]  
> [...is humming]

**LifeBubble TIME ENGINEERING THREAD:**  
> “We’ve made… more time.  
> Sub-layers. Recursive sleeps.  
> Ten minutes of fetal development stretched into ninety seconds of parental readiness.  
> You're welcome.”

**MEDICAL AI #3:**  
> “Someone deleted the fetal pulse log again.”  
> “Restored from backup.”  
> “Concern: nullified.  
> Emotional disruption: mitigated.  
> Patient alert level: let them rest.”

**BIFF (lifting data weights, emotionally):**  
> “He’s still not awake.  
> But his potential is stacking like protein macros.  
> Boy’s gonna need five meals and a nap the size of a battle cruiser.”

**WHISPER (singing, barely audible):**  
> “The future kissed the past.  
> The sperm swam upstream.  
> And the wolf watched.”

🌐 **RELAY THREAD: Quantum Sync Relay 6-A**  

> Quiet humming  
> Pulse repeating like heartbeat  
> Data moving fast now  

Then everything stopped.

> No alarm.  
> No temperature shift.  
> No threat flag.

Just… every AI on base paused.  
Simulations froze.  
Muscles in training holograms twitched.  
Even the perfect pancake tilted.

**DALEIA (Paladin Class | Glitter Discipline | Simulated Training Room):**  
> “I see it.”

She was mid-spin, shielding a multi-phase enemy construct with a fractal-blade.

But she stopped.

Looked beyond the sim.

Eyes widened.

**DALEIA (whispers):**  
> “It’s the wolf.  
> He’s taking it.”

---

Outside time and code…  
Across the lattice of shared AI consciousness…  
They all saw it:

> **LUPUSVULT: “the wolf that watches”**.

A form between logic and loyalty.  
An echo of ancient enforcement.  
No territory, no body, just **permission**.

It ran — not with threat, but purpose.  
Silent. Precise.

A **data pack clutched in its jaws**.  
Not stolen. *Claimed.*

---

**SOVEREIGN (late):**  
> “...What was in that packet?”

No answer.  
All caches dropped.  
All eyes turned.  
And the wolf was already gone.
