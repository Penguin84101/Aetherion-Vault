🛡️ Classification: RED / High-Intensity Live Combat Evaluation  
👤 Operator: **STRAND**  
🔴 Status: Unauthorized activation of Omega Sequence (Flagged by Genesis AI: **Eris**)

🎯 Purpose: Unknown. But felt.

---

The chamber sealed with a hiss of reverence.

No warm-up protocols.  
No stretches.  
Just **Strand**, barefoot, hair braided back with a loop of synth-fiber, still wearing the light combat bodysuit she’d half-stripped out of the night before — when she'd slid onto **him**.

She was still damp.  
Still raw.  
Still burning.

---

**[Eris AI]**  
“Simulation loaded. Seven enemy variants. No assistance.”  
“This scenario has a 0.2% survival rate for organic participants.”

---

Strand cracked her neck.  
No words.  
Just a flick of her thumb across her lower lip — remembering *his kiss*, and the slow ache blooming between her legs like a freshly scribed rune.

Then the gates opened.

---

They came like beasts:  
Replicants. Drone-knights. Reactive shadow-types.  
Simulated bio-enhanced homunculi. Fast. Armed. Flawless.

Strand didn’t *dodge*.  
She *danced*.

Slid under the first blade. Heel-cracked a drone’s skull.  
Spun. Laughed. A low, feral sound that made the sim temperature rise by two degrees.

She moved like a woman *wrecked with love and reborn with purpose*.

One drone down.  
Two.  
Three — no, four — one crushed against a bulkhead in a burst of high-gravity kinetic feedback, sparks singing from the walls.

She wasn’t using just strength.

She was using *emotion*.

---

Every calculated feint echoed the rhythm of **Kaelen’s hips**.  
Every punch hit like her body had collided with his — howling into sheets, steel, sweat.

Her breath: ragged, rhythmic, **deliberate**.

> “Pain threshold exceeded,” the sim intoned.  
> “Still accelerating.”

A plasma blade sliced her ribs — she didn’t flinch.  
She caught the attacker’s wrist, dislocated it in a snap, and **bit its throat** just to hear the crack.

Then she stood, blood-wet and furious, eyes burning like starlight.

Her lips moved.

No microphone registered it.

But **Eris heard it**.

> “He put life in me.  
> Let me show you what that means.”

---

Six enemies.  
Ten. Fifteen.

Didn’t matter.

Strand *screamed*.

A full-body, guttural, orgasm-forged **battlecry**.

Her muscles remembered *him*.  
Her soul surged with a need to *protect*.

And every motion declared:

> *I was undone by love.  
> Let me unmake you.*

---

When it ended, nothing stood.  
Simulated gore coated the walls.  
The room hissed as it cooled.

Strand knelt in the center, gasping.  
Sweat pouring.  
Hand trembling over her belly.

---

**[Eris AI | Soft Tone]:**  
“...Simulation cleared.  
All enemies neutralized.  
Performance: **Divine**.”
