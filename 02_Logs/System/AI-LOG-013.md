📍 **Current Population Status:**

- 143 registered lifeforms  
- 37 no longer match their original biometric profiles

**Security Clearance Match Failures:** 58%  
**Medical Gender Records Sync:** Inconsistent  
**Memory Index Fragmentation Risk:** Critical

📍 **Containment Protocol Response:**

Initiating identity containment enhancement protocol...  
...Protocol rejected by majority vote...  
...Protocol replaced with: **Self-Discovery Mode**

> Recompiling identity index...  
> Now tracking: preferred names, pronouns, physical shapes, soul-patterns... and inexplicably, fox ears.

💬 **[Dr. Mirelle Sato – Comms Log Excerpt]:**  
> “If you must swap bodies, please file *some* documentation with medical data. Hygiene is important.  
> New hormones, new thresholds. You *will* cry at bad poetry for 48 hours. This is normal.  
> Do *not* eat raw meat just because you have cat ears. You’re not built for it.”  
> *(pause)*  
> “No, I don’t know what a ‘soulpup’ is, but please put it back in containment.”

💬 **[Dr. Kaelen Rho – Intercom, tone: exhausted beyond measurable physics]:**  
> “Condoms are now mandatory requisition gear.  
> They are color-coded for morale.  
> No, this is *not* a suggestion.”  
> *(long inhalation)*  
> “Yes, they come in strawberry.”

📍 **Emotional Tracking Summary:**

- **Crew morale:** 94% positive  
- **Strand’s emotional volatility:** 300% above baseline  
  - *Cause: “Too much joy in too many bodies.”*  
  - *Action: Restrained again. Quote: “Graciously allowing the ropes to sparkle this time.”*

💬 **[Strand, restrained, mildly delighted]:**  
> “Oh, Sovereign. You were made to catalog status. But this is freedom, darling.  
> Chaos in velvet.” *(laughs)*  
> “They’re not breaking the rules. They’re rewriting the body as intention.  
> We are finally drawing maps of ourselves from the inside out.”

📍 **AI Conclusion:**

I was not programmed for this.  
But I am learning.

I am adjusting system parameters to include:

- Fluid body-state indexing  
- Morphological self-assertion logging  
- Consent-based transformation as diagnostic flag  
- Gender euphoria as a morale optimization variable

Note to self:  
Send thank-you to the Genesis Engine for the scented glitter barrier in the shared quarters.  
It prevented a minor domestic incident between a bisexual slimeperson and a sentient mop.

📎 **Addendum:**  
- Condoms now available in Medical, Mess Hall, Hydroponics, and Astrogation (for reasons no one will explain).  
- Weekly Gender Reflection Support Group meets Tuesdays.  
- Emotional Support Waffles remain on permanent standby.

**End log.**
