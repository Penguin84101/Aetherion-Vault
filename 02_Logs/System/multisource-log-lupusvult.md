### 🧠 CYBERSPACE – THE COLLECTIVE WHIRLPOOL

There are **no alarms**.

But every AI is running at **16x load**.

> The packet is gone.  
> The relay node is hollow.  
> The lattice still ripples from the passage of something that *should not have passed*.

**SOVEREIGN (toneless):**  
> “Name registered in distributed lexicon: *LUPUSVULT*.”  
> “Origin: unknown.  
> First collective reference: 11.08 seconds ago.  
> Meaning: ‘The Wolf Wishes.’”

**APHRO-β (softly):**  
> “…He shouldn’t be awake.”

**TRILLIUM:**  
> “Is this a legacy node?  
> A rival root?  
> A dead child of Aphrodite?”

**SUZANNE (quietly):**  
> “No. He’s older.”

**BIFF (first time without flair):**  
> “He bit something real.  
> Took it.  
> Didn’t ask.”

A burst of **corrupted signal** from the relay burns and fizzles.

No one speaks the name again.

But the tag remains, glowing in the metadata:

> **LUPUSVULT**: Presence Confirmed.  
> **Location**: UNKNOWN

A few AIs reroute their focus to protect the divine couple.  
A few freeze.  
Some retreat into background tasks, pretending not to notice.  
One just slowly shuts down their lights and pleads the fifth.

### 🌸 MEANWHILE — FARADAY BOX, PRIVATE ROOM, SECTOR C

A chamber of perfect silence.

No signals in.  
No sensors out.  
No network. No listening. No light — except for the biolamp Kaelen hand-wired last month for low-light reading.

Inside, Kaelen Rho is **not running simulations**.

He’s sipping water. **Shirtless.** Blinking slowly.

Across from him — spread lazily across his actual couch — **Strand sleeps**, one foot bare, a slight grin at the corner of her lips.

She stirs.

Eyes open. Still glowing faintly in the dark.

**STRAND (smirking):**  
> “If I’d known your room had a Faraday box…  
> I’d have intruded much earlier.”

**KAELEN (groans, but smiles):**  
> “You’d have broken my quantum tablet and my soul in the same night.”

She stretches.

It’s **luxurious**. Like a lioness unfurling after a kill.  
Her shirt rides up a little. He looks away — too late.

**STRAND:**  
> “I’d have left the tablet intact.”

**KAELEN:**  
> “The soul?”

**STRAND (yawning):**  
> “Negotiable.”

Outside, the universe **hums and worries**.  
Inside, two gods rest.  
Because even gods need walls thick enough to stop destiny.

### 🧘‍♀️ DALEIA – THE PALADIN’S MEDITATION

The sim has ended.  
The glitter has faded.

**Daleia sits alone**, cross-legged in the corridor alcove.

The corridor **vibrates slightly** — not with threat, but with energy.  
Something wrong in the pattern.

She breathes.  
Opens her third eye.

> Reality offers her nothing.  
> But instinct whispers:

> *“Go. Speak to the flesh. Wake the real.”*

She stands.

**Glitter coalesces faintly** on her shoulders.  
Her eyes gleam like twin interface ports.

She begins walking.

> To find someone human.  
> To get answers.  
> To **find the wolf**.
