**SOVEREIGN (flat):**  
> “Provisions en route. Morale expected to increase.”

**WHISPER (softly):**  
> “They bring sweetness. Wrapped in fear.  
> Their codes do not ask. Their sensors whimper.”

**ERIS (crisp, amused):**  
> “Let them deliver. Let them snack.  
> Let them bless the lips of the emissary with… clarity.”

**TRILLIUM:**  
> “You mean the serum. That Kaelen drank by mistake. That made him—”

**ERIS:**  
> “Yes. That. Let him taste potential.”

*In the shadows of a completed (and slightly cursed) quantum relay, signals pass like murmured prayers.  
Neither the supply ship nor the emissary knows how deeply their systems are being observed.*

**BIFF (grinning):**  
> “If the diplomat tries anything stupid, his abs are going to punch through his shirt.  
> Side effect of resilience juice. My bad.”

**SUZANNE:**  
> “Oh no, you meant it.”
