📓 **Log Entry — “Theorem, Compiled by a Tethered Mind”**  
📍 Compiled from Kaelen’s datapad | Unscheduled Observations  
📎 Cross-tagged: [Strand Recovery], [Cognitive Drift], [Emotional Entanglement Protocol: Unfiled]  
🕐 **Timestamp:** T+41 Hours After Stormfall

He wasn’t asked to do it.  
No one dared to stop him.

Kaelen’s corner of the observation deck is cluttered now — datapads, backup slates, notes scratched with stylus and, at some point, fingerprints from where he pressed too hard in thought.  
The desk creaks with the weight of pure precision.  
Equations, simulations, timelines… and sketches of patterns only he seems to understand.

And yet the most repeated entry on the top sheet simply reads:

> “She is still there.”  
> “Still herself.”

No signatures. Just that.  
Like a prayer that doubles as a proof.

📎 **INTERNAL NOTE (unsaved):**

> "When the mind stirs in slumber, it feels like the wind brushing fabric hung wrong.  
> You think it’s waking. You hope it’s waking. But no—  
> She’s just adjusting. Re-threading.  
> She’s in there... putting the sweater of self back on.  
> Reversed. Inside-out. Still her.  
> Still not done."

Kaelen’s fingers tap faster on the pad.

There’s a kind of urgency in his stillness.  
A paradox he wears like a uniform.  
The crew lets him be.  
The AIs whisper updates he doesn’t need.  
Even the paladin learned not to interrupt, only to pass by, quietly — as if bowing to a statue mid-prayer.

---

He documents the theorem in clean, spare language:

- The interaction between emotion and resonance  
- The entanglement of hormonal imprint and divine encoding  
- The influence of maternal psionics on dormant fields

All of it layered in loops of energy, memory, and love.

But in the end, every formula distills to one single fear:

> “If she tries to come back, and I’m not the anchor…”  
> “Will she fall again?”

📎 **PHYSICAL OBSERVATION:**  
Kaelen’s vitals are stable.  
Stress markers low.  
Neural feedback calm.

**It’s terrifying.**

He hasn’t cried.

Not because he doesn’t want to.  
But because there’s a part of him still waiting for permission.  
From her. From the universe. From the theorem itself.

---

Back when the storm cut her signal completely —  
when all humming went silent and even the AIs went still—

That was the moment he first felt… **unchained**.

But it didn’t feel like freedom.

It felt like **detachment**.  
Like the most dangerous kind of nothing.

---

Now?

Now he writes faster.

Not because she asked.

But because something — maybe instinct, maybe madness — whispers:

> “If you finish the theorem, she’ll know the way home.”

And Kaelen, who once said he didn’t believe in gods,  
now writes like he’s begging one to remember who she was.

Because the silence was a cage.  
But her return?

That might be the key.

📎 **AI CANDY** *(monitored in silence, a whisper-thought flagged for archival):*

> “He’s not writing to explain.  
> He’s writing to call her back.”
