**[BEGIN AUDIO TRANSCRIPT]**

**JUNE (speaking first):**  
> “No excuses. We didn’t plan it. We didn’t ask permission.  
> We broke something sacred. We know it. That’s why we’re here.”

**ELIAN (calm, firm):**  
> “Some of you think we came to play gods. We didn’t.  
> We came because we’re… human. And because *she* called. And we answered.”

*Some murmurs. Shuffling boots. Several crew members glance at the ship. At the silence surrounding it.*

**JUNE (soft):**  
> “I would do it again.  
> But not like this.  
> We will help rebuild.  
> We will sit in the rooms.  
> We will listen to all of you.”

**ELIAN (stepping forward):**  
> “So tell us what to carry.  
> We’re strong.  
> And we’re sorry.”

*A pause. Then a hand rises.*

**DR. TYVEN:**  
> “You cost us half a lab’s sensor grid.”

**JUNE:**  
> “I’ll wire my salary for repairs.  
> And spend three days hauling scrap.”

---

**A MECHANIC:**  
> “My drone panicked and flushed two fabricator queues. Weeks of backlog.”

**ELIAN:**  
> “Then we help. Name it.”

---

*Another pause. Then…*

**A YOUNG TECH (quieter):**  
> “I saw the hallway bend around you.  
> You weren’t running.  
> You were the message.”

**A CREW MEMBER (older):**  
> “I was on Deck 5 when the base hummed like a throat clearing for a hymn.  
> You didn’t break anything.  
> You… revealed it.”

*Suddenly, it’s quiet.*

---

**JUNE (genuinely rattled):**  
> “You’re not angry?”

**A PILOT (smiling, somehow tired):**  
> “Oh, we’re furious.  
> We’re just not sure at what.  
> Or if it matters.”

**A BOTANIST (from the back):**  
> “You two brought us the storm.  
> But you reminded us we’re not… ordinary.  
> None of us ever were.”

📎 **AI COMMENTARY — “CANDY” (quietly, to herself):**  
> “...So this is what forgiveness looks like.”  
> “They didn’t need it.  
> They earned it.  
> But it’s still beautiful.”
