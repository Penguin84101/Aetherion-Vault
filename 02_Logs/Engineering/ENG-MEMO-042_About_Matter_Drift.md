Team,

Please be advised: multiple observations now confirm the spontaneous formation of *localized radial mass spirals* in low-traffic ventilation and infrastructure zones.

Composition: mixed debris — mineral grit, synthetic dust, structural fragments.  
Configuration: axial symmetry increasing in pitch-locked layers.  
Notable behavior: *mild vibrational hum* under material strain — currently non-harmful.

Initial assumption was post-convergence turbulence. That no longer holds.

We are now logging:

- Density increases in aligned materials (some beginning to crystallize)
- Repetitive scanner malfunction on standard composition scans
- Pattern overlap with previously reported “song-stone” residue

Recommendation:

✅ Begin passive **Matter Drift Mapping** in all F–H maintenance ducts  
✅ Coordinate with Station AI for **hum signature indexing**  
✅ Do not disturb spiral cores without full resonance damping gear

If these are self-assembling harmonic structures, even low-grade interference could trigger feedback.

Command has not issued a lockdown directive, and Kaelen insists this is “safe.”

*I recommend we behave as though it isn’t.*
