plot_hooks:
  - Song-stones are confirmed as crystallized Aetherion structures.
  - Kaelen openly connects physics to emotional resonance.
  - Strand begins to emotionally destabilize under field influence.
  - Tessa’s POV adds humor and humanization of a cosmic-scale event.
  - Base is now interpretive, not just reactive — which is a major escalation.

Today I tried to understand the Theory of Everything.  
I also zip-tied a possibly divine being to a bench for public safety.

So, you know. Normal Tuesday.

Let me back up.

This morning, during a routine inspection of the lateral heat exchangers (again — thanks, Kaelen, for not writing any schematics), I found a rock.

Not uncommon. We've had stray debris since the Aetherion convergence warped local mass density.

But this wasn’t just “space rock” rock.

It was **humming**.

Not loudly — but harmonically. Like the thing was tuned.

I ran standard diagnostics. The readings weren’t just bad — they were *impossible*. The scanner looped itself trying to interpret mass vs. density vs. gravity resonance.

So I did what any responsible technician does when physics goes sideways:

I brought it to **Dr. Kaelen Rho**.

He sighed so loudly it triggered a whiteboard.

> “Sit,” he said. “You’re about to get a flash lecture.”  
> “...Is it contagious?” I asked.  
> “More than you know.”

**Strand** was already there.  
Which is *normally* comforting.

Except she was strapped to a bench with carbon restraints and looked way too happy about it.

> “We restrained her,” Kaelen muttered, seeing my expression. “She was feeling too much again. Said she could *‘hear the lattice of reality blushing’.”*

Whatever *that* means.

### 🔬 LECTURE SUMMARY:

The rocks are **crystallized Aetherion deposits**, formed in high-gravity inertial drift.

They're "**song-stones**" — each one resonates on frequencies that interact with **fundamental forces**.

Kaelen says the Theory of Everything now includes:

- Strong Nuclear  
- Weak Nuclear  
- Electromagnetic  
- Gravitational  
- **Kinetic** *(thanks to Hammer Girl — his words, not mine)*

These rocks?  
Nature’s tuning forks. Resonance anchors.

He paused, then dropped this:

> “They’re not just responsive.  
> They’re *communicative*.  
> The base is becoming... *interpretive*.”

Strand **giggled**.  
Then **cried**.  
Then **sang** half a nursery rhyme in a voice that wasn’t hers...

...and the rock in my hand hummed back — **in rhythm**.

We tightened her restraints. Just a little.

Kaelen kept going:

> “The Theory isn’t just physics anymore, Ril.  
> It’s resonance between *intention and force*.  
> We’re not measuring the universe.  
> We’re asking it questions.  
> And it’s starting to answer back.”

I stared at the stone.

It pulsed when he said that.  
Like it *agreed*.

So now I’ve got:

- A bag of **harmonic gravel**
- A multi-unified force theory unfolding in real-time
- And a half-naked alien genius tied to the emergency safety bench because she claims the **rocks are flirting with her**

Anyway.  
I fixed the heat exchanger.

But I think my definition of “fixing things” might be out of date.

**End log.**
