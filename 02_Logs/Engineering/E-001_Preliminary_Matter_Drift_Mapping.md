plot_hooks:
  - Song-stones are beginning to form throughout the station, unnoticed by most.
  - Suggests early signs of resonance-based self-assembly from local debris.
  - Introduces baseline scanner inconsistency and low-level “hum” phenomena.
  - Subtle implication that the station's structure is beginning to respond to harmonic feedback.

Conducted a sweep of low-traffic decks for latent post-resonance stress.  
Found unexpected mass convergence along the ventilation arrays between Decks F and H.

Local dust aggregates have begun forming radial spirals near junction ports — spiral nests, almost biological in patterning.

Not magnetic. Not adhesive.  
Materials range from metal shavings to hydrogel fragments and mineral grit. All rotating on-axis. All aligned with vent fans set to **idle** or **off**.

I ran density scans — some of the deposits are solidifying.  
Structure is unfamiliar. Scanner threw three format errors and tried to flag one fragment as “biogenic crystal.” That’s... not a real category.

Some of the formations hum faintly under strain — audible only under vibrocoil contact.  
Not a whine. Not static. More like... a pitch.

Kaelen calls it an “Aetherion echo.” Of course he does.

📍 **Internal Note to Engineering Chief:**

We might want to formalize a **Matter Drift Map** system-wide.  
If this is happening across the station, we’re looking at a slow reconfiguration of debris zones into resonant clusters.

Not dangerous — yet.  
But weird? Very.

And the weirder it gets, the more it feels like the base is... listening.

**End log.**
