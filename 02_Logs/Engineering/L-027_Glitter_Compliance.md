  - Introduces the now-official “glamour shielding” policy and its absurd but necessary details.
  - Highlights technician frustration, disbelief, and reluctant admiration for Kaelen.
  - Establishes glitter as a lab hazard (and possibly a stabilizing force).
  - Sparks future ideas: are emotional states influencing radiation shielding?

📎 **INTERNAL LAB SAFETY MEMO**  
**To:** All Lab-Adjacent Personnel  
**From:** Technician Marlo Penn  
**Subject:** Glitter Containment and Glamour Shielding Compliance

Let me start by saying:

I didn’t expect this either.

But yes — it’s official.  
**“Emergency Glitter Filters”** are now standard lab equipment.

Dr. Rho pushed the requisition through Station Command using a clause titled *“Incandescent Residual Particulate Containment, Class-4 (Theatrical Aetherion Fallout)”*.  
Which apparently *counts* as a real risk vector under Genesis Protocol Subsection 3.9.6.

That man filed a functional lab safety guideline based on *sparkle drift*.

And Command approved it.

📍 **New Safety Measures Include:**

- Fine-mesh glitter capture screens installed over all experimental lattice cavities.
- Lab vacuum thresholds increased to filter “narrative residue” (we’re not kidding — it’s in the form now).
- Reagent lockers fitted with visual shimmer-dampening panels.
- All personnel in Labs Theta through Omega are now required to wear protective glam-goggles if within 6 meters of Daleia during an active pose cycle.
- **New signage** installed:
  
  > ⚠️ CAUTION: Narrative-Linked Transformation Events May Produce Sparkle Fallout.  
  > Wear boots with good traction. No swooning in containment zones.

📍 **FAQ (Unfortunately, This Is All Real)**

**Q:** Are we seriously classifying glitter as a Class-3 volatile?  
**A:** Yes. Glitter particles embedded with Aetherion harmonics *do* refract coherent light beams into self-sustaining auroral loops.  
This caused a 3-hour optical cascade last night that crashed three microscopes and gave Dr. Sato mild euphoria.

**Q:** Is Daleia a registered energy source now?  
**A:** According to Kaelen’s own notes, she emits “post-glamour resonance” strong enough to align unstable fields through dramatic flair.  
So, technically... yes?

**Q:** Why are we calling it “Glamour Shielding”?  
**A:** Because he called it that on the requisition form. And it was approved.  
He spelled “glamour” with a “u.” For elegance.

📍 **Action Items**

- All lab staff must complete the new **“Sparkle Safety & You”** training module by the end of the week.
- Do *not* store emotionally unstable samples near Daleia’s resting zone.
- If your hair begins to levitate during experiment alignment, evacuate immediately.
- Please stop putting googly eyes on the field stabilizers. They are not sentient. Yet.

📎 **Closing Note:**

We used to be a research station.

Now we are *also* a fashion-forward narrative singularity held together by duct tape, sarcasm, and a post-human glitter goddess with excellent boots.

Please wear gloves.
