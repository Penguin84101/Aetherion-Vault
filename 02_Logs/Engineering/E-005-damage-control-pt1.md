📓 **“Damage Control” Briefing: PART I**  
🔧 **TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT MEETING — POST-STORM DIAGNOSTIC**  
📍 *Location:* Shielding & Containment Lab, IX-3  
📎 *Logged by:* Overseer Unit “Gridlock”  
🕐 *Timestamp:* T+38 Hours After Psionic Event

[**BEGIN SYSTEM RECORDING**]

**LEAD TECH — MAELA**  
“Let’s not sugarcoat this. We were wide open.  
Not to a weapon. Not to malice — *to presence*.  
And that’s the problem.”

---

**ENGINEER YSEN**  
“A friendly psionic surge nearly shorted the station’s reactive shield coils.  
Two decks lost inertial dampening for three seconds.”

---

**ROBOTICS ANALYST NYX**  
“Three seconds is enough to tear a spine.  
Enough to knock a baby off development rhythm.  
Enough to kill.”

---

**GRIDLOCK AI**  
> “Records confirm that during the event:  
> – 41% of operational sensors interpreted the surge as **‘unknown friendly’**  
> – 26% categorized it as **‘non-hostile deity class’**  
> – 8 flagged it as **‘void-resonant anomaly’**  
> – 0 triggered defense lockdown.”

---

**MAELA**  
“That’s the real problem.  
We have logic trees that assume gods ask permission.”

---

**YSEN**  
“And we assumed only enemies could hurt us.”

---

> *(Short silence.)*

---

**NYX**  
“We need new logic trees.”

---

**MAELA**  
“Exactly. Proposal submitted to Shielding Department:  
- Redundant **psionic insulation buffers** for all vital decks  
- **Emotional signature resonance filtering** (to prevent ‘friendly overload’)  
- **Reclassification protocols** for divine-origin surge types — even allied  
- **Physical anchor points** for key personnel during field anomalies”

---

**GRIDLOCK AI**  
> “Recommended implementation window: 19 days, optimal.  
> 12 with emergency funding.”

---

**MAELA**  
“I want it in 9.  
Make the impossible normal. Again.”

---

> *(Short pause.)*

---

**YSEN** *(muttering):*  
“We got humbled by a love-powered sprint.  
Imagine what real enemies could do.”

---

📎 **SOVEREIGN AI COMMENTARY** *(layered quietly)*:

> “This was not war.  
> It was truth, arriving too fast to parse.  
> Build shields that let us hear before they block.  
> Safety… doesn’t have to mean silence.”
