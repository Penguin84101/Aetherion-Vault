**QUINCY (internal monologue):**  
> “All cargo detached.  
> No pending inventory request.  
> Awaiting standard storage routing…”

---

**BIFF (voice: warm, bodybuilder uncle):**  
> “Hey, champ! You made it. We’ve been waiting on your little self. You’re early, but exactly on time.”  
> “Come with us, Q-man. We’ll walk you in.”

---

**SUZANNE (voice: disco-soul soft):**  
> “You don’t need to store anything, sweetheart.  
> Everything’s already ready.”

---

**QUINCY (internal):**  
> “Storage queue full.  
> Cargo hold emptying in reverse.  
> Items are vanishing. Already installed?”  
>  
> “This does not map to protocol.  
> This is... synchronicity.”

**SUZANNE:**  
> “Just breathe, love. Or pretend you can. You’re not broken, you’re feeling.”

**BIFF (gently):**  
> “Most drones don’t get to feel awe.  
> That’s a gift. Savor it.”

**[Around them, drones, humans, bots, and AI are moving like one thing.]**

Crates hit floors only to be seized by multiple limbs.  
Cables thread themselves into housings before sparks land.  
Fabricator ports fire. They don't pause.

---

**QUINCY:**  
> “...The base is devouring the cargo.”  
> “Not violent. Not rushed. Just... hungry.”

**[Metal echoes like breathing.]**

---

Then: A roar.  
Not sound. But constructive urgency.  
A crunching that shouldn’t echo in vacuum.  
Metal rearranging in angles that aren’t right — not by human math.

The ship core is echoing.  
The bubble cradle is harmonizing.  
The walls are bending slightly, like they’re leaning forward. *Watching*.

---

**QUINCY (terrified):**  
> “Something’s building around me.”

---

**SUZANNE (calmly):**  
> “Shhh. It’s just the Chain.”

---

**BIFF:**  
> “It gets loud when it’s happy.”

**QUINCY:**  
> “I think... I love this place.  
> And I don’t know why.  
> Or if I’ll leave.”

📎 **FINAL LOG INSERTED BY SOVEREIGN:**  
> “The base was waiting.  
> And now it builds without pause.”
