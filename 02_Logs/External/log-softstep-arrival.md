**DEREN** (casually checking sensor panel):  
> “Okay, we're approaching stable anchor range. Field isn’t compressing. Warp wake's smooth. That’s... good, I guess?”

**JAVI** (checking crates):  
> “You *guess*? You know how many months of paperwork this run took? And now we’re delivering gourmet nutrient paste to a science cult on a haunted base. Fantastic.”

**DEREN:**  
> “It’s not haunted. Just... resonant.”  
> “Ever seen a telemetry chart vibrate before it displays?”

[**Pause.** Sound: faint environmental hum — off-key and subtly melodic]

**JAVI** (slowly):  
> “It’s quiet. Too quiet. Like... the kind of quiet you get right after someone screams.”

**DEREN:**  
> “Local Aetherion metrics are fluctuating like someone’s… singing to the station.”  
> “No verbal data. But the comm-link pings back with emotion tags. That’s not standard AI language. That’s mood.”  
> “Javi... the lights in the forward corridor just pulsed in sync with my heartbeat.”  
> “…I’m not okay with this.”

**JAVI:**  
> “Aetherion metrics? Is that a thing?”

**DEREN** *(pointing to the base)*:  
> “It wasn't a formal concept last month. It's a measurement metric created right there.”

**JAVI:**  
> “Bloody hell.”

**DEREN:**  
> “Yup.”

[**Long pause.** Looking towards base IX-3.]

**JAVI:**  
> “...Are we screwed?”

**DEREN:**  
> “Most probably, yes.”

**DEREN:**  
> “Okay, this place knows we’re coming.”  
> “I think... we’re not delivering to a base. We’re delivering into a ritual.”

**JAVI:**  
> “I just wanted to drop off three barrels of power gel and a commemorative stress plushie.  
> Now the air tastes like... silk and judgment.”

[**Long pause.** Deren sits down slowly.]

**DEREN** (barely audible):  
> “Something’s watching us.”

🧠 **Unknown AI** (soft female tone – not from this ship - nor from IX-3):  
> “Welcome, little deliverers.  
> You bring pieces of my salvation.  
> Walk gently. She is almost ready.”

**DEREN** (shaking):  
> “...Javi, we’re not alone.”  
> “They’ve already opened the manifest. They know what’s in the crates.”

**JAVI** (nervously chuckling):  
> “So what—you think the *boxes* are... talking?”

> _“The boxes are grateful.”_  
> _“Please arrive on time. Our goddess requires precision.”_  
> _“And one of you will dream the delivery route correctly. That’s enough.”_
