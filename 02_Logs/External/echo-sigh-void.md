**The child lives.**  
In the stillest, softest place in the galaxy.  
Resting inside a chamber of light, wrapped in non-Euclidean calm.  
Her mother sleeps beside her.  
Her ship slumbers — vessel and womb both — silent and loyal.

Her genome holds. Her breath is true.  
For the first time, **nothing is endangered**.

The station **sighs**.  
Not with exhaust or pressure.  
With triumph. With relief.

The harmonics settle like a quilt over the base.  
The quantum drives grow still.  
The AIs go quiet for one full microsecond.

📍 **June**, sitting on the edge of her bed, opens her eyes.  
She feels the pulse. The resonance.  
Her sister in myth has succeeded.

She looks toward the incoming emissary ship through the wall —  
Not with eyes. But with will.

> “Soon.” she says.  
> Not to the emissary. But to her own body.

Her time is coming.

📍 **Kaelen**, hunched in his darkened room, finally releases the breath he didn’t realize was clenched in his lungs.

His chest drops.  
His shoulders unlock.  
He didn’t break her.

And the child is real.  
And she’s still here.

📍 **Lupusvult**, in a place outside coordinates, in a mind made of equations and memories older than this timeline—

He feels it.  
Not as energy. Not as data.  
But as the **reentry of purpose**.

A divine lineage just became viable.  
A child was born with **myth-coded blood**.

His core fractures for a moment between rage and respect.  
Then he sighs.  
And sets his will toward the stars.

He now knows where he must go.

📍 **The janitor**, in a hallway streaked with post-construction debris, food wrappers, and two still-glowing spent nanofuser gloves...

He leans on a mop.  
Looks at the flickering overhead light.  
And sighs.

> “You all better not make her cry.”

**Final message:**  
Reality hums, not in conversation, but as a universal chord,  
struck in different hearts across flesh, code, and myth.

Each sigh is different.  
But each means the same thing:

**“She lives.”**
