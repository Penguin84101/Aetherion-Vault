📤 **TRANSMISSION [PRIORITY-BETA | ROUTED VIA LAGRANGE NODE]**

To: IX-3 Station Authority  
From: Obsidian Corridor – Forward Logistics Branch  
Subject: Scheduled Entry Cadence for Diplomatic Emissary

In light of IX-3’s recent reclassification to **Aetherion-Harmonic Zone: Fluctuating**, and the ongoing **quantum instability of relay signal structure**, please confirm receipt of the following procedural cascade:

---

📦 **Provisions Vessel**  
**[TAG: SOFTSTEP-ECHO]** will arrive in **14h standard**.

🧬 Contents include medical, nutritional, cultural, and diplomatic support materials.

🧴 Special Request Fulfillment for active crew submitted as *“Morale Buffers”* — **approved**.

🧠 Requested tissue regenerative accelerants (**REDLACE vials**): 3x volumes delivered **“in error.”**

🚫 **Emissary vessel [SOVEREIGN INTERLOCK 1]** will **not** breach warp-layer until **relay-temper clearance** passes **Phase IV**.

Your **resonance profile** has not been officially audited.  
This is *not* a challenge — but a **delay for integrity**.

📎 *Note:* “Said emissary is annoyed. He can stew.”  
📎 *Note2:* “He will also receive an unmarked silver vial. Its taste is tropical. Its effect is permanent.”  
📎 *Note3:* “The AIs are not required to explain themselves.”
