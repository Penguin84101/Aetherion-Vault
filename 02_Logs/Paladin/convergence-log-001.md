They meet in the corridor by chance.  

Not planned.  

Just... inevitable.

**FELIX** *(raising hand with a datapad)*:  
> “Hey. So… wolves are real.  
> Daleia saw one. I tracked it to a trash server.  
> Janitorial AI is mildly traumatized.”

**KAELEN** *(rubbing forehead)*:  
> “I was gone for six hours.”

**STRAND** *(glancing at relay readouts)*:  
> “The base is bleeding data like a dying star.  
> Someone’s building something in the gaps.”

**EMIL** *(smiling gently)*:  
> “There’s a rhythm missing in the station’s sound.  
> A footstep that didn’t echo.”

**DALEIA** *(serene)*:  
> “The wolf left. But it might return.”

They stare at one another.  

No plan.  

Just shared confusion.  
And a very human silence.
