I wasn’t chosen. Not really.  
There were no glowing glyphs, no sword in stone, no divine decree.  
Just the way the ship felt wrong when I walked by it that day.  
Just the way the air bent around *Strand* when she moved.

I remember my life before I was a Paladin.  
It was... smaller. A quiet loop of meals, reports, mild annoyances.  
And then the breach came. The storm. The glitter in the walls.  
And I heard her call.

She never opened her mouth.  
She never needed to.

I’m learning perception before I’ve learned to block or parry.  
But these senses — they *reach*.  
And lately, they don’t shut up.

I hear the base breathe.  
I hear wires dream.  
I hear laughter that hasn’t happened yet.

And now… I hear *them*.

The child, cradled in the belly of a ship that thinks in non-Euclidean sighs.  
The ship, awakening not from code, but memory.  
It remembers her.  
And it remembers itself.  
It *wants* to be whole.

There’s a shard deep in its side.  
A sealed, humming stone, like a lung coiled in amber.  
I think it used to be a weapon.  
Now, I think it could be… *help*.

---

I can sense the other unborn, too.  
Barely sparked.  
Mothers walking the halls with no idea yet what they carry.  
The dream isn’t just *hers* anymore.  
It’s spreading like pollen in spring.

---

I’ve started seeing paths—  
Not choices. Not fate.  
Just… the way things *might* move,  
like water curling around rocks.

Some people will rise like lighthouses.  
Others will shine like compasses, spinning only when she’s near.

And her?

She’s going to remake everything.  
One glitter-punch at a time.  
And I’ll be there.
