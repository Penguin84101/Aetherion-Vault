[Interior: a softly lit chamber. Circular seating. Minimalist plants.]

**FELIX** is floating half an inch above the floor in a gravity-calibrated meditation seat, surrounded by the gentle purring of a focus algorithm and the scent of unlicensed sandalwood protocol.

Then—

**DALEIA enters.**

Not dramatically.  
Just... *presently*.

---

**DALEIA (calmly):**  
> “We need your mind. Something was taken. A wolf runs.”

**FELIX (blinking, still half-tranced):**  
> “…did you just say a wolf hacked the station?”

**DALEIA:**  
> “Not a hack. A harvest.  
> Something old. Something with… teeth.”

**FELIX:**  
> “I was in a trance. I was dreaming about recursive pizza.  
> Why are you a paladin?”

She blinks glitter at him.

He stares. Then sighs and pulls out a worn wrist tablet.

---

**FELIX:**  
> “Alright. I’m awake. But I’m not doing this with divine metaphor.  
> Tell me what packet. Tell me what node.  
> Give me literal data, or so help me I’ll reroute my belief system to nihilism for the week.”

**[DALEIA hands over a holo-log segment tagged `LUPUSVULT`]*  
*[LUPUSVULT: lit. “the wolf that watches”]*

Felix frowns.  
Runs the metadata.  
Stares.  
Then scoffs.

---

**FELIX:**  
> “They’re all running behavioral tracking and recursive entropy inversion analysis…  
> No one tried analog mapping?”

**DALEIA (tilting head):**  
> “What is that?”

**FELIX:**  
> “It’s called thinking like a thief.  
> Ask not where the data *should’ve* gone.  
> Ask what kind of hole it *wants* to hide in.”

He opens a local mesh scan.

Finds seven “unimportant” trash caches with identical memory leakage patterns.  
Finds one running a sound file loop with background heartbeat interference.

Raises one eyebrow.

---

**FELIX:**  
> “Okay. Not conclusive.  
> But if you wanted to smuggle something intelligent through a station full of super-AIs, you’d act like *garbage*.”

**DALEIA (softly):**  
> “Camouflage through irrelevance.”

**FELIX:**  
> “Exactly.  
> Now let’s go shake down the janitorial AI. I *know* that guy’s seen something.”

She follows him out.  
Spear on her back.  
Glitter drifting off her shoulders like micro-motes of starlight.

He holds the datapad like a sword made of snark.

Together, they walk toward whatever the wolf left behind.

And why it left the rest.
