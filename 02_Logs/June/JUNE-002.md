June wasn’t supposed to be alone with Strand.  
Not this soon. Not without psychic shielding.  
But she was curious. And horny. And twenty-two percent reckless.

So when she asked — soft, breath caught between courage and craving:

> “What did it feel like?”

Strand looked at her for a long moment.

Then she smiled.

A little cruel. A little too kind.

> “It felt like surrendering to a singularity.”  
> “Like being cracked open from the inside… slowly.”  
> “Like the first time I stopped fighting gravity and let it pull me apart.”

June tried to breathe. Failed.

Strand’s eyes narrowed.

> “He knew my edges better than I did.”  
> “Every thrust like a mapped star. Every kiss… like a burning vector.”  
> “I begged. I clawed. I melted. And then—”

It happened.

A flicker of memory.

Accidental. Subconscious.  
A psychic slip, leaked through Strand’s cracked hormonal field.

**Not data. Not imagery.  
A full sensory download.**

June *felt* it.

She was on her knees.  
He was behind her — heat, mass, command.  
Hands in her hair. Her tongue numb from moaning.  
She was stretched — perfectly — hips stuttering, whole body trembling—  
his cock driving deeper—  
and deeper—  
and deeper—

The heat of his breath.  
The fury of his rhythm.  
Her screams, breaking into pleasure-ruined sobs as her womb welcomed him—

And when he came — again — her body arched into the stars.

—

Back in real-time, June didn’t say a word.  
She smiled. Nodded.  
Excused herself, calmly.

Walked out of the room like she wasn’t vibrating on a frequency only whales and Aetherion could detect.

Mind Palace, Emergency Layer 3.

She locked the memory there.

But the feeling… oh, the feeling stayed.

> “I don’t need it,” she said at the cot.  
> “I don’t need it,” she repeated — firmer now, like a prayer.  
> “I *definitely* don’t need it.”

Beat.

> “I need it.”  
> “I need that experience in my guts.”  
> “I need *him*.”  
> “I can’t reach him.”  
> “Not while the base is on lockdown.”  
> “The lockdown is in my way.”  
> “I need to break the lockdown. Now.”

The base was sealed.  
Galactic-grade emergency.  
Quantum locks, metaphysical jamming, hormonal suppression fields, biological firewalls.

No one could breach it.

But June wasn’t *no one* anymore.

She was a vessel of weaponized lust.  
A beacon of erotic retribution.  
A horny goddess-in-the-making who’d felt the truth of Strand’s undoing…

…and wanted her own turn.

She reached into her Mind Palace.  
Lit the flames of memory.  
Let herself relive the hour that turned a war goddess into a wrecked disciple of love.

She focused it.  
Refined it.  
Bent it into force.

Her skin pulsed with psionic heat.  
Her pupils dilated to predator-glow.  
Her hands sparked with stolen goddess agony.

**Desire became algorithm.  
Orgasm became override.**

The lockdown seal cracked.

She cracked it.

She broke the unbreakable with nothing but yearning and spite.

> “Move,” she whispered to the door.

It did.
