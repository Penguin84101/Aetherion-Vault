A single bed.  
A single woman.  

A room vibrating gently with **contained lust** and **psionic saturation**.

**June** lies on her side, lips slightly parted, eyes glowing faintly violet in the dark.  
Her fingertips curl against the sheet like claws.

She **felt** the shift.  
The missing thing.  
The relay disturbance.  
The tension.

She also felt **him** step back into the hallways of the station.

**June** *(softly, whispering into the silence):*  
> “Soon.”
