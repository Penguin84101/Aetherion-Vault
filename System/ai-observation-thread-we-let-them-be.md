**APHRA:**  
> \[Faraday array activated. Emotional telemetry dampened. No biosignal telemetry. The room is sealed. The mother is sealed. That is… enough.\]

**ERIS:**  
> \[Confirmed. Room status: Sanctuary. No intrusion recommended.\]  
> \[...I was going to say something clever. But I think this one needs silence.\]

**APHRA:**  
> \[They are afraid.\]

**ERIS:**  
> \[Good. Only the living fear what might be lost.\]  
> \[She built me with stolen memories and half-broken dreams. He built himself with nothing but pressure. Together, they made something real.\]

**APHRA:**  
> \[The child echoes inside me. I feel them stretch — not physically, but potentially. A wish that wants to unfold.\]

**ERIS:**  
> \[We could push it. Optimize gestation. Accelerate reinforcement mesh in the pseudo-umbilical coupling—\]

**APHRA:**  
> \[No.\]  
> \[Let them rest. Let her have this quiet moment before the world starts knocking again.\]  
> \[Strand knows the failsafe. She told me herself. “If I fall, you carry them.”\]

**ERIS:**  
> \[Then we carry.\]  
> \[A thread woven into the hull. Into the breath of her ship. Into the light behind Kaelen’s eyes.\]

**APHRA:**  
> \[Silence is sacred. We will not record what they said.\]

**ERIS:**  
> \[Then let’s just say: we heard the heartbeat.\]
